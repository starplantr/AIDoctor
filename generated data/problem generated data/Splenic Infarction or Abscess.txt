**Case 1:**

A 44-year-old woman comes to the emergency department complaining of a sudden onset of severe pain in the left upper quadrant of her abdomen that radiates to her left shoulder. The pain started while she was at home, and it has been gradually increasing. She also has a fever, chills, and is feeling generally unwell. Her past medical history is significant for sickle cell disease.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Splenic Infarction**. Given her history of sickle cell disease, she is at a high risk of blood clotting and occlusion of the vessels, leading to organ infarction. Her presentation with severe left upper quadrant pain, fever, chills, general malaise, and left shoulder pain (Kehr's sign) suggests an infarction in the spleen.

**Case 2:**

A 56-year-old man with a history of intravenous drug use and recent diagnosis of infective endocarditis presents with severe left upper quadrant pain, fever, and chills. He also complains of nausea and fatigue. His vitals reveal a high temperature and increased heart rate.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Splenic Abscess**. His recent diagnosis of infective endocarditis associated with intravenous drug use puts him at a higher risk for septic emboli, which can cause a splenic abscess. His symptoms of severe left upper quadrant pain, fever, chills, nausea, and fatigue are consistent with this diagnosis.

**Case 3:**

A 35-year-old woman with a history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia presents to the clinic with severe left upper quadrant pain, fever, and diarrhea. She also mentions feeling extremely tired. On physical examination, her spleen is palpable and tender.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Splenic Infarction**. Her history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia predisposes her to the formation of blood clots due to increased breakdown of red blood cells and subsequent hypercoagulability. The presentation of severe left upper quadrant pain, fever, diarrhea, and fatigue aligns with splenic infarction.

**Case 4:**

A 64-year-old man with a history of liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension presents with left upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting. He also reports feeling weak and has been having fevers and chills at home. His medical records indicate a previous episode of bacterial peritonitis.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Splenic Abscess**. His history of liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and previous bacterial peritonitis presents a risk for bacterial translocation and seeding of the spleen, potentially leading to an abscess. His symptoms of left upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, fever, and chills are indicative of a splenic abscess.

**Case 5:**

A 28-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a severe pain in his left upper quadrant after a motor vehicle accident. He also complains of left shoulder pain. His vitals show tachycardia and a fever. The patient reports feeling unwell and is nauseous.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is a **Splenic Infarction or Abscess** secondary to trauma. The traumatic event could have caused damage to the spleen leading to an infarction, or introduced an infection leading to an abscess. The patient's symptoms

 of severe left upper quadrant pain, left shoulder pain (Kehr's sign), fever, general malaise, and nausea are indicative of a spleen-related issue. Further diagnostic workup would be required to definitively distinguish between infarction and abscess.

**Case 6:**

A 45-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of intermittent fever and left upper abdominal pain over the past week. The patient, a farmer, mentions a recent tick bite while working in his field. He has a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, currently in remission. On examination, the spleen is palpable and tender.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is a **Splenic Infarction or Abscess**. Given his history of a tick bite, he could have contracted a tick-borne infection leading to septicemia, which might have led to the formation of a splenic abscess. Alternatively, his history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia could predispose him to a hypercoagulable state leading to a splenic infarction. The symptoms of fever, left upper quadrant pain, and a tender palpable spleen are common to both conditions.

**Case 7:**

A 38-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease on dialysis presents with severe pain in her left upper abdomen that radiates to her left shoulder. She also reports chills, nausea, and fatigue. Examination reveals a tender, enlarged spleen.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Splenic Infarction**. Her end-stage renal disease and dialysis treatment put her at increased risk for thromboembolic events due to alterations in coagulation factors and platelet function. Her presentation of severe left upper quadrant pain radiating to the left shoulder (Kehr's sign), chills, nausea, and fatigue suggests a splenic infarction.

**Case 8:**

A 50-year-old woman presents to the emergency department complaining of severe left upper quadrant abdominal pain. She has a fever, and her past medical history is significant for intravenous drug use and recent hospitalization for pneumonia. Physical examination reveals tenderness in the left upper quadrant.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Splenic Abscess**. The patient's history of intravenous drug use increases the risk of septicemia, which may have led to an abscess. Additionally, recent pneumonia could have provided a source for bacteremia, potentially seeding the spleen.

**Case 9:**

A 32-year-old man with a history of sickle cell disease presents with severe pain in his left upper quadrant that started suddenly while he was playing basketball. He also reports fatigue, and examination reveals an enlarged and tender spleen.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Splenic Infarction**. His history of sickle cell disease predisposes him to vaso-occlusive crises, which can result in organ infarctions including the spleen. His symptoms of severe left upper quadrant pain, an enlarged and tender spleen, and fatigue are indicative of this condition.

**Case 10:**

A 52-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presents with left upper quadrant pain, chills, and malaise. Her diabetes has been poorly controlled, and she was recently hospitalized for cellulitis of the leg. On examination, her spleen is palpable and tender.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Splenic Abscess**. Her poorly controlled diabetes and recent cellulitis could have led to bacteremia, potentially resulting in a splenic abscess. Her symptoms of left upper quadrant pain, chills, general malaise, and a tender, palpable spleen are consistent

 with this diagnosis. 

**Case 11:**

A 20-year-old man presents with severe left upper quadrant pain that started after a car accident. He also reports nausea, and on examination, the spleen is palpable and tender.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is a **Splenic Infarction or Abscess**. Trauma, as in this case due to a car accident, could lead to both splenic infarction and abscess. The trauma may have caused damage to the splenic vessels leading to infarction, or could have led to infection and abscess formation. 

**Case 12:**

A 55-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis due to alcohol abuse presents with left upper quadrant pain and fever. He has been generally unwell for several weeks. On examination, his spleen is enlarged and tender.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Splenic Abscess**. His history of cirrhosis, a condition that compromises the immune system, increases the risk of infections, which could lead to abscess formation. His symptoms of left upper quadrant pain, fever, general malaise, and an enlarged, tender spleen are consistent with this diagnosis.

**Case 13:**

A 60-year-old woman presents with left upper quadrant pain that started a week ago. She also reports chills and has lost weight recently without trying. She has a history of gastric cancer and underwent partial gastrectomy five years ago. On examination, the spleen is palpable and tender.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is a **Splenic Infarction or Abscess**. The patient's history of gastric cancer and partial gastrectomy could have led to a hypercoagulable state, predisposing her to splenic infarction. On the other hand, it could have also predisposed her to infections, which could have resulted in a splenic abscess. Her symptoms of left upper quadrant pain, chills, unintended weight loss, and a tender, palpable spleen are indicative of either of these conditions.

**Case 14:**

A 65-year-old man presents with severe left upper quadrant pain, fever, and chills. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on anticoagulation therapy. On examination, the spleen is palpable and tender.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Splenic Infarction**. His history of atrial fibrillation, even though on anticoagulation, predisposes him to thromboembolic events, which can lead to a splenic infarction. His symptoms of severe left upper quadrant pain, fever, chills, and a tender, palpable spleen are indicative of a splenic infarction.

**Case 15:**

A 40-year-old woman with a history of intravenous drug use presents with left upper quadrant pain, fever, and malaise. On examination, the spleen is palpable and tender.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Splenic Abscess**. Her history of intravenous drug use increases the risk of systemic infections, which could lead to an abscess in various organs including the spleen. Her symptoms of left upper quadrant pain, fever, general malaise, and a tender, palpable spleen are consistent with this diagnosis.
