**Case 1:**

A 65-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe, sudden onset of abdominal pain, which she describes as the worst she has ever felt. She has been feeling nauseated and has had bouts of diarrhea. Her medical history is significant for atrial fibrillation, for which she is on anticoagulation therapy. On examination, her abdomen is tender but not distended, and bowel sounds are hyperactive.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis is **Acute Mesenteric Ischemia (AMI)**. The patient's severe, sudden abdominal pain, along with nausea and diarrhea, are consistent with AMI. Her history of atrial fibrillation is a significant risk factor as it could lead to the formation of a clot, which could embolize to the mesenteric vessels and cause ischemia.

**Case 2:**

A 70-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and high blood pressure presents with abdominal pain that usually occurs about 30 minutes after eating. He reports that he has been avoiding food due to the pain, and he has lost significant weight over the past few months. On examination, his abdomen is soft and non-tender.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis is **Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia (CMI)**. The patient's postprandial abdominal pain and significant weight loss are classic symptoms of CMI. His history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and high blood pressure, which are cardiovascular risk factors, make CMI a likely diagnosis.

**Case 3:**

A 60-year-old woman presents to the clinic complaining of recurrent episodes of abdominal pain that start within an hour after eating. The pain is severe enough to make her stop eating, and she has lost weight over the past couple of months. She has a past medical history of smoking and high cholesterol. On examination, the abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no palpable masses.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis is **Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia (CMI)**. The patient's history of postprandial abdominal pain leading to food avoidance and weight loss is typical of CMI. Her history of smoking and high cholesterol are significant risk factors for atherosclerosis, which is the usual cause of CMI.

**Case 4:**

A 72-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain that started suddenly a few hours ago. He reports that he has had diarrhea and has vomited twice since the pain started. He has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent a cardiac catheterization a week ago. His abdomen is diffusely tender on examination.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis is **Acute Mesenteric Ischemia (AMI)**. The patient's sudden, severe abdominal pain, along with diarrhea and vomiting, suggests AMI. His history of coronary artery disease and recent cardiac catheterization procedure could have led to the formation and subsequent embolization of a clot, causing AMI.

**Case 5:**

A 68-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and diabetes presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of abdominal pain. She also reports multiple episodes of vomiting and diarrhea. On examination, the abdomen is tender to palpation but not distended.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis is **Acute Mesenteric Ischemia (AMI)**. The patient's sudden, severe abdominal pain, along with nausea and diarrhea, suggests AMI. Her history of hypertension and diabetes, which are risk factors for vascular diseases, makes AMI a likely diagnosis.

**Case 6:**

A 75-year-old man with a history of smoking and high cholesterol presents to the clinic. He has been experiencing recurrent abdominal pain that seems to occur soon after meals. He states that he has lost his appetite due to the pain and has lost weight as a result. On examination, the abdomen is non-tender and non-distended, and bowel sounds are normal.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis is **Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia (CMI)**. This is characterized by recurrent postprandial pain leading to fear of eating and subsequent weight loss. The patient's history of smoking and high cholesterol are significant risk factors for atherosclerosis, which is the usual cause of CMI.

**Case 7:**

A 67-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation and heart failure comes to the emergency department complaining of severe abdominal pain that started suddenly earlier in the day. She also reports nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Her abdomen is tender, but not distended, on examination.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis is **Acute Mesenteric Ischemia (AMI)**. The patient's sudden, severe abdominal pain, along with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are typical of AMI. Her history of atrial fibrillation and heart failure are significant risk factors, as they can lead to the formation of a clot, which could embolize to the mesenteric vessels, causing ischemia.

**Case 8:**

A 72-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and smoking comes to the clinic complaining of recurrent abdominal pain that usually occurs after eating. The pain is severe enough that he has started to avoid eating, leading to significant weight loss. On examination, his abdomen is non-tender, and bowel sounds are normal.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis is **Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia (CMI)**. The patient's postprandial abdominal pain and significant weight loss are classic symptoms of CMI. His history of hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, which are cardiovascular risk factors, make CMI a likely diagnosis.

**Case 9:**

A 64-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain that started suddenly a few hours ago. She also has nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She has a past medical history of chronic kidney disease and underwent cardiac catheterization two weeks ago for evaluation of chest pain. On examination, her abdomen is tender but not distended.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis is **Acute Mesenteric Ischemia (AMI)**. The patient's sudden, severe abdominal pain, along with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, suggests AMI. Her chronic kidney disease and recent cardiac catheterization procedure are significant risk factors that can lead to AMI. 

**Case 10:**

A 66-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia and smoking presents to the clinic with complaints of recurrent episodes of abdominal pain that begin about an hour after eating. She reports that she has started to avoid food due to the pain, leading to weight loss. On examination, the abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no palpable masses.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis is **Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia (CMI)**. The patient's history of postprandial abdominal pain leading to food avoidance and weight loss is typical of CMI. Her history of hyperlipidemia and smoking are significant risk factors for atherosclerosis,

 which is the most common cause of CMI. 

**Case 11:**

A 77-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation for which he is on anticoagulation therapy, presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain. He also has nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. On physical examination, his abdomen is diffusely tender.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis is **Acute Mesenteric Ischemia (AMI)**. This patient's sudden, severe abdominal pain accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are consistent with AMI.
