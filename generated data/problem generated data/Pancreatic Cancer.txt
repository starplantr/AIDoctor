The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **pancreatic cancer**. Her symptoms of pruritus (itching), dark urine, steatorrhea (greasy stools), and loss of appetite, along with her recent diagnosis of diabetes, are indicative of pancreatic cancer. Her obesity is also a risk factor for pancreatic cancer.

**Case 3:**

A 75-year-old man visits his primary care physician for a routine check-up. He reports a recent unintentional weight loss of 15 pounds over two months and abdominal discomfort that radiates to his back. He has a history of heavy smoking and was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **pancreatic cancer**. His presentation of unintentional weight loss and abdominal pain radiating to the back, coupled with a new onset of diabetes and a history of heavy smoking, point to pancreatic cancer. These symptoms are often seen in advanced disease, and given his risk factors, this diagnosis is a strong possibility.

**Case 4:**

A 65-year-old woman presents with complaints of persistent abdominal pain that radiates to her back, yellowing of skin and eyes, and loss of appetite. She also mentions having itchy skin for the past few weeks. She has a family history of pancreatic cancer, with her father having died from the disease. She is a non-smoker and does not have a history of diabetes or pancreatitis.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **pancreatic cancer**. Her symptoms of jaundice, pruritus, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain radiating to the back, combined with a family history of pancreatic cancer, are indicative of this diagnosis.

**Case 5:**

A 70-year-old man visits his doctor reporting fatigue, unintended weight loss, and a persistent dull ache in his abdomen that sometimes radiates to his back. He has a past medical history of Lynch syndrome, a condition that increases the risk of certain types of cancer.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **pancreatic cancer**. Her symptoms of pruritus, dark urine, weight loss, loss of appetite, and steatorrhea, combined with her medical history of Lynch syndrome, suggest pancreatic cancer. Lynch syndrome is a genetic disorder that increases the risk of various cancers, including pancreatic cancer.

**Case 14:**

A 68-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of persistent fatigue, loss of appetite, and unexplained weight loss. He also has a dull, persistent pain in his upper abdomen that sometimes radiates to his back. He has a history of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and is a lifelong smoker.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **pancreatic cancer**. His symptoms of fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, and abdominal pain radiating to the back, along with his new onset of diabetes and a history of smoking, point to pancreatic cancer.

**Case 15:**

A 76-year-old woman presents with complaints of itchy skin, yellowing of skin and eyes, and persistent abdominal pain that sometimes radiates to her back. She also reports unintentional weight loss and changes in her bowel movements, noticing they have become light-colored and greasy. Her medical history includes BRCA2 gene mutation and obesity.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is pancreatic cancer.

Her symptoms of jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), pruritus (itchy skin), persistent abdominal pain radiating to the back, unintentional weight loss, and changes in stool characteristics are classic presentations of pancreatic cancer. These symptoms occur due to the mass effect of the tumor and obstruction of the bile duct leading to the accumulation of bilirubin, which results in jaundice and pruritus. The changes in stool characteristics are caused by impaired fat digestion due to inadequate pancreatic enzyme secretion.

Additionally, the presence of a BRCA2 gene mutation in her medical history is significant as it increases the risk for pancreatic cancer. Her obesity is also a recognized risk factor. The patient's advanced age aligns with the epidemiology of the disease, which is more common in older adults. It's important to consider pancreatic cancer in any older adult with new onset of these symptoms, especially those with risk factors such as a history of BRCA2 mutation and obesity.
