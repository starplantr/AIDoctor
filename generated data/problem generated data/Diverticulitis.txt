**Case 1:**

A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency room with severe pain in his lower left abdomen. He says the pain has been gradually worsening over the past three days, and nothing he does seems to ease it. He denies any recent trauma or injury. He also reports feeling nauseous and has vomited twice this morning. On examination, you find the left lower quadrant of his abdomen is tender on palpation. He has a history of diverticulosis and has been taking ibuprofen daily for his arthritis for the past year. He smokes half a pack of cigarettes a day and admits his diet could be healthier as he doesn't consume much fiber and tends to eat more meat and dairy products. 

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

This patient's symptoms, combined with his medical history, suggest a diagnosis of **Diverticulitis**. Diverticulitis typically presents with worsening pain in the lower left quadrant of the abdomen, which this patient has. He also reports nausea and vomiting, which can be associated with this condition. This patient has several risk factors for diverticulitis, including a known history of diverticulosis, the regular use of NSAIDs (which can increase the risk of diverticulitis), and lifestyle factors such as a low-fiber, high-animal fat diet and smoking.

**Case 2:**

A 67-year-old woman comes to the clinic complaining of persistent lower abdominal pain for the past week, which has been constant and unrelenting. She says the pain is most severe on the left side. She also reports having a fever for the past two days and feeling generally unwell. On physical examination, you note tenderness in the lower left quadrant of her abdomen. She has a medical history significant for obesity and is currently on steroid medication for her rheumatoid arthritis. She is not physically active and has a diet primarily of processed foods low in fiber.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

This patient likely has **Diverticulitis**. She has several of the typical symptoms of this condition, including persistent pain in the lower left side of her abdomen, fever, and general malaise. Moreover, her risk factors include obesity, a diet low in fiber, lack of physical activity, and the use of steroids, all of which increase the likelihood of developing diverticulitis. 

**Case 3:**

A 70-year-old man visits your clinic with complaints of lower abdominal pain and changes in his bowel habits over the past week. He reports that the pain is constant and localized to the left side of his lower abdomen. He has also been experiencing alternating bouts of constipation and diarrhea. He has a history of diverticulosis, is a long-term smoker, and leads a sedentary lifestyle. His diet is low in fiber and high in red meat.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is **Diverticulitis**. His symptoms of lower left-sided abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, along with his risk factors of smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and a low fiber-high meat diet, all point towards diverticulitis. His history of diverticulosis further increases his risk of diverticulitis.

**Case 4:**

A 65-year-old woman presents to your office with a complaint of sudden onset of severe left-sided abdominal pain which has been increasing over the last two days. She also reports low-grade fever and feeling unusually bloated. On physical examination, you note tenderness in her lower left abdomen. She mentions that she has been a heavy smoker for over 40 years and does not follow any regular exercise routine. She has a previous medical history of diverticulosis and takes ibuprofen regularly for her chronic knee pain.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

This patient's presentation of left-sided abdominal pain, low-grade fever, bloating, history of smoking, lack of physical activity, regular use of NSAIDs, and a known case of diverticulosis strongly suggests **Diverticulitis**.

**Case 5:**

A 69-year-old man comes to your clinic complaining of pain in the lower right side of his abdomen, which he says has been steadily worsening for the past few days. He also reports feeling nauseous and having a fever. He is of Asian descent and mentions that he has been diagnosed with diverticulosis in the past. He admits to not getting much exercise and his diet is high in animal fats and low in fiber.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

Despite the fact that pain from diverticulitis typically occurs in the lower left side of the abdomen, in people of Asian descent, it's more common for the pain to be on the right side, as is the case with this patient. His worsening pain, nausea, and fever, coupled with a past history of diverticulosis and a low-fiber, high-animal fat diet, point to a diagnosis of **Diverticulitis**.

**Case 6:**

A 73-year-old woman visits your clinic with a complaint of lower abdominal pain and constipation for the past week. She also mentions that she has had a mild fever for the last couple of days. On physical examination, her lower abdomen, especially the left side, is tender to touch. Her medical history includes diverticulosis, and she is currently on a steroid medication for her autoimmune disease. She admits that she doesn't exercise and her diet is predominantly processed food low in fiber.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The patient's lower abdominal pain, constipation, mild fever, known history of diverticulosis, use of steroid medication, lack of exercise, and a diet low in fiber, all contribute to a likely diagnosis of **Diverticulitis**.

**Case 7:**

A 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe pain in his lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. He says the pain has been worsening over the last three days and is accompanied by nausea and a feeling of bloating. On examination, the left lower quadrant of his abdomen is tender. His medical history is significant for obesity and he has been on NSAIDs for a while due to his chronic lower back pain. He also mentions that he's not very physically active and his diet mostly consists of meat and dairy products.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The patient's severe, worsening lower abdominal pain, along with nausea, bloating, obesity, NSAID use, lack of physical activity, and a high-animal fat diet, are consistent with a diagnosis of **Diverticulitis**.

**Case 8:**

A 71-year-old woman comes to the clinic with a week-long history of lower abdominal pain, occasional nausea, and low-grade fever. The pain is constant, unrelieved by defecation, and located on the

 left lower quadrant of her abdomen. Her past medical history is significant for diverticulosis. She has been taking ibuprofen for her arthritis regularly and admits to being a smoker for more than 40 years. Her diet is low in fiber, mostly consisting of red meat and white bread.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

This patient's constellation of symptoms (left lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and low-grade fever), personal habits (smoking, low fiber diet), chronic use of NSAIDs, and past medical history of diverticulosis all point toward a diagnosis of **Diverticulitis**.

**Case 9:**

A 66-year-old man visits your clinic with complaints of lower abdominal pain and diarrhea. The pain is constant, localized to the left side of his lower abdomen. His medical history reveals a previous diagnosis of diverticulosis and he is currently on steroid therapy for an autoimmune disease. He has a sedentary lifestyle and his diet is rich in animal fats and low in fiber.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

This patient's lower left-sided abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, past history of diverticulosis, use of steroids, sedentary lifestyle, and a diet high in animal fats and low in fiber all suggest a likely diagnosis of **Diverticulitis**.

**Case 10:**

A 74-year-old woman presents with complaints of lower abdominal pain for the past 5 days. The pain is constant and primarily located in the lower left quadrant. She also reports a decreased appetite, low-grade fever, and general malaise. She has a history of diverticulosis and takes aspirin daily for her cardiovascular disease. She mentions a diet mostly consisting of processed foods and admits to smoking.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

This patient's presentation of left-sided abdominal pain, decreased appetite, low-grade fever, general malaise, history of diverticulosis, regular use of NSAIDs, smoking habit, and diet high in processed foods are highly suggestive of **Diverticulitis**.

**Case 11:**

A 68-year-old man presents to your clinic with severe left-sided abdominal pain that has been increasing over the last 3 days. He also mentions having a fever and feeling nauseous. On physical examination, you note tenderness in the lower left quadrant of his abdomen. He has a previous medical history of diverticulosis and takes ibuprofen regularly for his chronic back pain. He is a heavy smoker and follows a diet high in red meat and low in fiber.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

This patient's left-sided abdominal pain, fever, nausea, known history of diverticulosis, regular use of NSAIDs, smoking habit, and diet low in fiber and high in red meat strongly point to a diagnosis of **Diverticulitis**.
