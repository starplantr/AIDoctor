A 50-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain and nausea. He also reports that he has been feeling increasingly itchy over the past few days and noticed that his eyes have turned yellow. He has a past medical history of liver cirrhosis secondary to alcoholism.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Biliary Obstruction**. His history of liver cirrhosis and his symptoms of severe right upper quadrant pain, nausea, itching, and jaundice suggest biliary obstruction, possibly due to the development of bile duct strictures or stones as a complication of cirrhosis.

**Case 5:**

A 78-year-old woman is brought to the clinic by her daughter who noticed that her mother's skin and eyes had turned yellow. The patient complains of dark urine and pale stools over the past week. She also mentions loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss. Her medical history is significant for a cholecystectomy performed 20 years ago.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Biliary Obstruction**. Her history of cholecystectomy and her symptoms of jaundice, dark urine, pale stools, loss of appetite, and weight loss suggest biliary obstruction. This could be due to adhesions or scar tissue from her previous surgery.

**Case 6:**

A 63-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of severe abdominal pain, specifically in the right upper quadrant. He also reports itchy skin, dark urine, and pale stools. On examination, he is found to be jaundiced. The patient's history is significant for chronic cholangitis.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Biliary Obstruction**. His history of chronic cholangitis along with his presenting symptoms - severe upper right quadrant pain, itchy skin, jaundice, dark urine, and pale stools, suggest a blockage in the bile ducts, possibly due to the inflammation or scarring caused by his chronic cholangitis.

**Case 7:**

A 70-year-old woman presents to the hospital with complaints of upper right quadrant abdominal pain, dark urine, and a noticed yellowing of the skin and eyes. Additionally, she has had an unexplained weight loss and has been experiencing episodes of fever and night sweats. She has a history of pancreatic cancer for which she was treated two years ago.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Biliary Obstruction**. Her history of pancreatic cancer combined with her presenting symptoms - right upper quadrant pain, dark urine, jaundice, weight loss, and fever - suggest that she may have a recurrence of her cancer causing obstruction of the bile ducts.

**Case 8:**

A 68-year-old man presents to the outpatient clinic with jaundice, dark urine, pale stools, and itchy skin. He also reports having lost some weight over the past month without trying. He had a liver transplant 10 years ago due to chronic liver disease.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Biliary Obstruction**. His history of liver transplant and the presented symptoms of jaundice, dark urine, pale stools, pruritus, and unintentional weight loss are indicative of biliary obstruction. Scar tissue or a stricture in the bile ducts, which can occur after a liver transplant, could be causing his symptoms.

**Case 9:**

A 66-year-old woman reports to the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant, which has worsened over the last few days. She also notes a fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss. Her skin and eyes appear yellow. She has a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Biliary Obstruction**. Her history of primary sclerosing cholangitis and her symptoms of abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, and weight loss suggest biliary obstruction. Primary sclerosing cholangitis can lead to scarring and narrowing of the bile ducts, leading to obstruction.

**Case 10:**

A 55-year-old woman presents to the hospital with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant. On physical examination, she appears jaundiced, and her skin is itchy. She also reports that she has been passing dark-colored urine and her stools have been unusually pale. She had undergone an open cholecystectomy 15 years ago.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Biliary Obstruction**. Given her history of cholecystectomy and the presenting symptoms of nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, pruritus, jaundice, dark urine, and pale stools, these are all indicative of biliary obstruction. Adhes ions or scar tissue from her previous surgery could be causing her symptoms.

**Case 11:**

A 60-year-old man with a history of liver cirrhosis presents to the clinic with complaints of yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes, and dark urine for the past week. He also reports unintentional weight loss, fever, and night sweats. His wife mentioned that he's been unusually itchy as well. 

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Biliary Obstruction**. His history of liver cirrhosis could lead to biliary obstruction due to liver damage and altered bile flow. His symptoms - jaundice, dark urine, weight loss, fever, night sweats, and pruritus, are consistent with biliary obstruction.

**Case 12:**

A 72-year-old woman presents to the hospital with severe pain in her right upper quadrant, which started a week ago. She also complains of itchy skin, nausea, and vomiting. On examination, she is found to be jaundiced. Her medical history includes gallbladder polyps discovered three years ago.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Biliary Obstruction**. Her history of gallbladder polyps, which could have increased in size, combined with her presenting symptoms - severe right upper quadrant pain, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice, suggest a blockage in the bile ducts.

**Case 13:**

A 65-year-old man with a history of chronic alcoholism reports to the emergency department with abdominal pain, fever, and jaundice. He also mentions having itchy skin and notices that his urine has been darker than usual. His past medical history reveals recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Biliary Obstruction**. His history of chronic alcoholism and recurrent pancreatitis might have resulted in pancreatic ductal damage and inflammation leading to biliary obstruction. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, pruritus, and dark urine align with this diagnosis.

**Case 14:**

A 67-year-old woman presents to the clinic complaining of pruritus, dark urine, pale stools, and unexplained weight loss over the last month. She also has a noticeable yellowing of the skin and eyes. She has a history of choledochal cysts, diagnosed in her childhood.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Biliary Obstruction**. Her history of choledochal cysts could have led to an obstruction in her bile ducts. The clinical symptoms of jaundice, pruritus, dark urine, pale stools, and weight loss are indicative of biliary obstruction.

**Case 15:**

A 70-year-old woman with a past medical history of intrahepatic stones presents with abdominal pain, fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss. On examination, she is jaundiced and has dark urine. She also complains of itchy skin and pale stools.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*
