**Case 1:**

A 42-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with intense pain in the right upper quadrant of her abdomen that started a few hours ago. She rates the pain as 9 out of 10 and says it seems to radiate to her right shoulder. The patient also reports nausea and two episodes of vomiting. Her medical history is significant for obesity and multiple pregnancies. She admits she has been trying to lose weight rapidly for the past few months.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

This patient's symptoms of severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain radiating to the right shoulder, nausea, vomiting, and a significant history of obesity and rapid weight loss are consistent with **cholecystitis**, a condition often triggered by gallstones, to which the patient's obesity and rapid weight loss predispose her.

**Case 2:**

A 58-year-old man presents to the clinic with a history of recurrent right upper quadrant abdominal pain for the past six months. He describes the pain as sharp and constant, often occurring after meals. Physical examination reveals tenderness in the right upper quadrant. His past medical history reveals that he is diabetic and has lost a significant amount of weight over the past year due to dietary changes.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

Given the patient's history of recurrent right upper quadrant pain, particularly after meals, along with tenderness upon physical examination and a medical history of diabetes and significant weight loss, the most likely diagnosis is **cholecystitis**. Diabetes and rapid weight loss are known risk factors for gallstones, which can lead to cholecystitis.

**Case 3:**

A 47-year-old woman visits the emergency department complaining of severe, sudden-onset pain in the right upper quadrant of her abdomen that started a few hours ago. She reports feeling feverish and having vomited twice since the pain began. Her past medical history reveals she has had four children and had been diagnosed with gallstones three years ago.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The patient's symptoms of severe right upper quadrant pain, fever, vomiting, a history of multiple pregnancies, and a previous diagnosis of gallstones all point towards a likely diagnosis of **cholecystitis**. Having multiple pregnancies and a history of gallstones increases the risk of developing cholecystitis.

**Case 4:**

A 65-year-old man presents with a 2-day history of pain in the right upper part of his abdomen, which he describes as constant and sharp. He also reports having a fever and experiencing nausea. His medical history is significant for a recent diagnosis of a bile duct tumor.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The patient's right upper quadrant pain, fever, nausea, and a history of a bile duct tumor suggest a diagnosis of **cholecystitis**. Although gallstones are the most common cause, a tumor in the bile duct can also cause obstruction, leading to cholecystitis. 

**Case 5:**

A 55-year-old woman presents with a history of recurring abdominal pain over the past year, mainly in the upper right quadrant. She describes the pain as crampy and states it often follows meals. She also reports recent episodes of nausea. She has a history of sickle cell disease and has been diagnosed with gallstones in the past.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The patient's symptoms of recurring right upper quadrant pain often following meals, nausea, and a medical history of sickle cell disease and gallstones suggest a likely diagnosis of **cholecystitis**. Sickle cell disease can lead to an increased risk of gallstones and subsequent cholecystitis.

**Case 6:**

A 37-year-old woman visits the emergency department complaining of severe pain in her right upper abdomen that started suddenly this morning. She describes the pain as aching and persistent, rating it as an 8 on a scale of 10. She also feels nauseated and feverish, and her medical history is notable for two pregnancies and rapid weight loss over the past few months.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The patient's severe right upper quadrant pain, nausea, fever, and medical history of multiple pregnancies and rapid weight loss are indicative of **cholecystitis**. Rapid weight loss and multiple pregnancies are known risk factors for gallstones, which can lead to cholecystitis.

**Case 7:**

A 50-year-old man presents to the clinic with recurrent right upper quadrant abdominal pain that typically occurs after meals. He also mentions occasional nausea. The patient has a history of cystic fibrosis, a condition known to predispose to gallstones. 

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

This patient's recurrent postprandial right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and history of cystic fibrosis suggest a probable diagnosis of **cholecystitis**. Patients with cystic fibrosis often have abnormalities in their bile composition that can lead to gallstone formation and subsequently to cholecystitis.

**Case 8:**

A 60-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe pain in the upper right portion of her abdomen that started a few hours ago. She says the pain radiates to her right shoulder and is accompanied by a fever. Her past medical history is significant for obesity and a recent bout of severe pneumonia.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

Given the patient's symptoms of severe right upper quadrant pain radiating to the right shoulder, fever, and a history of obesity, the most likely diagnosis is **cholecystitis**. Obesity is a known risk factor for gallstones, which are the leading cause of cholecystitis.

**Case 9:**

A 40-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of sharp pain in her right upper abdomen that usually occur after meals. She also reports occasional bouts of nausea and vomiting. Her medical history is notable for multiple pregnancies and rapid weight loss after adopting a strict diet six months ago.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The patient's recurrent right upper quadrant pain post-meals, nausea, vomiting, and history of multiple pregnancies and rapid weight loss point toward a likely diagnosis of **cholecystitis**. Rapid weight loss and multiple pregnancies increase the risk of gallstones, the most common cause of cholecystitis.

**Case 10:**

A 56-year-old man visits the emergency department with severe, sudden-onset right upper quadrant abdominal pain that has persisted for several hours. The pain is associated with nausea and a mild fever. His medical history is significant for a recent diagnosis of a pancreatic tumor.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The patient's symptoms of severe right upper quadrant pain, nausea, fever, and a history of a pancreatic tumor suggest a diagnosis of **cholecystitis**. Pancreatic tumors can cause obstruction of the cystic or bile duct, leading to cholecystitis.

**Case 11:**

A 35-year-old woman presents with right upper quadrant pain that typically worsens after meals, and is accompanied by nausea. Her past medical history is notable for Crohn's disease and she mentions having lost significant weight over the past few months.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

Given the patient's recurrent postprandial right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and a medical history

 of Crohn's disease and rapid weight loss, the most likely diagnosis is **cholecystitis**. Both Crohn's disease and rapid weight loss can increase the risk of gallstones, leading to cholecystitis.

**Case 12:**

A 66-year-old woman presents to the emergency department complaining of severe pain in her right upper abdomen that began suddenly a few hours ago. She describes the pain as stabbing and unrelenting, and she also reports fever and nausea. The patient's medical history is significant for diabetes and obesity.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

This patient's symptoms of severe right upper quadrant pain, fever, nausea, and a medical history of diabetes and obesity are indicative of **cholecystitis**. Diabetes and obesity are known risk factors for gallstones, which can precipitate cholecystitis.

**Case 13:**

A 42-year-old man presents to the clinic with recurrent abdominal pain in the upper right quadrant. He states the pain often follows meals and describes it as sharp and severe. He also experiences occasional bouts of nausea and has a history of sickle cell disease.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

Given the patient's symptoms of recurrent right upper quadrant pain often following meals, occasional nausea, and a history of sickle cell disease, the most likely diagnosis is **cholecystitis**. Sickle cell disease can lead to an increased risk of gallstones and subsequent cholecystitis.

**Case 14:**

A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe pain in her right upper abdomen that began suddenly early this morning. The pain is severe and is associated with a fever and nausea. Her medical history is significant for rapid weight loss and multiple pregnancies.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

The patient's severe right upper quadrant pain, fever, nausea, and a history of rapid weight loss and multiple pregnancies suggest a diagnosis of **cholecystitis**. Rapid weight loss and multiple pregnancies are risk factors for gallstones, which are a common cause of cholecystitis.

**Case 15:**

A 38-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of sharp, severe pain in her right upper abdomen that usually occur after meals. She also experiences intermittent bouts of nausea and vomiting. Her medical history is significant for obesity and a family history of gallstones.

*What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?*

Given the patient's symptoms of recurrent right upper quadrant pain post-meals, nausea, vomiting, and a medical history of obesity and a family history of gallstones, the most likely diagnosis is **cholecystitis**. Obesity is a known risk factor for gallstones, which are the leading cause of cholecystitis.
