**What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?**

The most likely diagnosis is gallstones. Pregnancy and the postpartum period are known risk factors for gallstones due to hormonal changes that increase the cholesterol content in bile. The patient's symptoms of sudden, intense, right upper abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting suggest a gallstone obstructing the bile duct.

**Case 12:**

A 48-year-old woman with a history of using oral contraceptive pills for several years presents with sudden and severe pain in her right upper abdomen. The pain is associated with nausea and vomiting and has been steadily worsening over the last couple of hours.

**What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?**

This patient likely has gallstones. The use of oral contraceptives is a known risk factor for gallstones due to the increased estrogen levels, which can increase cholesterol levels in bile and decrease gallbladder movement. Her symptoms of severe right upper abdominal pain, associated with nausea and vomiting, are indicative of gallstone disease.

**Case 13:**

A 60-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis presents to the emergency department with severe pain in his upper right abdomen that started suddenly a few hours ago. The pain has been gradually worsening and is accompanied by fever and chills.

**What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?**
