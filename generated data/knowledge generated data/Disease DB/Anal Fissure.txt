**Anal Fissure**

An anal fissure is a small tear in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) that lines the anus.

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Common symptoms of anal fissure include:

- Pain during and after bowel movements (often described as a sharp, searing or burning pain)
- Blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet after bowel movement
- A visible tear or cut in the anus or anal canal
- A small lump or skin tag on the skin near the anal fissure

**2. Natural History:**

Anal fissures can occur at any age and are often seen in infants and young children since constipation is a common problem in these age groups. While many anal fissures heal on their own or with non-surgical treatment, some fissures may persist and become chronic, requiring surgical intervention.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Anal fissures are a common condition. They can occur in individuals of all ages, and are equally common in men and women. They are more prevalent in younger adults, and the incidence tends to decrease with age.

**4. Etiology:**

Anal fissures typically are caused by trauma to the inner lining of the anus. A hard or large stool can cause tiny tears in the anus. Other common causes include:

- Straining during childbirth
- Increased tension in the two muscular rings (sphincters) controlling the anus
- Chronic constipation or diarrhea
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Anal intercourse

**5. Pathophysiology:**

The exact pathophysiology of anal fissures is not completely understood. The most accepted theory is that an increased anal sphincter pressure contributes to the development of anal fissures. The increased pressure in the internal anal sphincter can reduce blood flow to the anal mucosa, leading to ischemia (lack of blood supply), and ultimately to a tear or fissure.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Conditions that may present similarly and need to be differentiated from anal fissures include:

- Hemorrhoids
- Anal abscess or fistula
- Anal cancer
- Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

This can be caused by passing large or hard stools, chronic diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, and conditions that affect anal muscle tone. Age can also affect the risk, as the blood flow to the anorectal area decreases with age.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

A history of constipation or frequent diarrhea can predispose an individual to developing anal fissures. Similarly, a history of childbirth can be associated with the condition due to possible trauma during delivery. Those with a history of Crohn's disease or other inflammatory bowel disease are also at an increased risk.
