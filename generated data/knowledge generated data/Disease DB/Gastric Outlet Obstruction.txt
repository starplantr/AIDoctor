**Gastric Outlet Obstruction (GOO)**

Gastric outlet obstruction is a clinical syndrome characterized by epigastric pain and fullness, nausea, vomiting of undigested food, and weight loss due to mechanical obstruction.

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Symptoms include nausea, persistent vomiting (often of undigested food), early satiety (feeling full after eating a small amount of food), weight loss, and dehydration. In severe cases, patients may present with malnutrition or signs of severe dehydration.

**2. Natural History:**

If untreated, gastric outlet obstruction can lead to severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and malnutrition. Symptoms may progressively worsen over time.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Gastric outlet obstruction can occur at any age but is most common in older adults. The incidence is declining due to decreasing rates of peptic ulcer disease, one of the most common causes of GOO.

**4. Etiology:**

Causes of gastric outlet obstruction can be benign or malignant. Benign causes include peptic ulcer disease, gastric polyps, or ingestion of caustic substances. Malignant causes include gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, or metastatic cancer to the stomach or nearby organs.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

Gastric outlet obstruction occurs when there's a blockage in the stomach or the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) that prevents gastric emptying. This obstruction can occur due to something inside the lumen (like a gastric polyp), in the wall of the stomach or duodenum (like cancer or a peptic ulcer), or outside the lumen compressing it (like a pancreatic tumor).

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

The differential diagnosis for gastric outlet obstruction includes:

- Gastroparesis
- Gastric volvulus
- Intestinal pseudo-obstruction
- Anorexia nervosa or other eating disorders

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

This can occur due to a variety of reasons such as peptic ulcers, noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant) tumors, ingestion of corrosive substances, certain infections, or chronic inflammation (gastritis).

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

Previous history of peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer, or pancreatic cancer can increase the risk of developing gastric outlet obstruction. Prior gastric or duodenal surgery can also predispose to this condition.
