**Diverticulitis**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Diverticulitis occurs when the small pouches, known as diverticula, in the digestive tract become inflamed or infected. Symptoms include:

- Pain that is usually constant and persisting for several days. The lower left side of the abdomen is the usual site of the pain. Sometimes, however, the right side of the abdomen is more painful, especially in people of Asian descent.
- Nausea and vomiting.
- Fever.
- Abdominal tenderness.
- Constipation or, less commonly, diarrhea.

**2. Natural History:**

Diverticulosis is a condition characterized by the presence of these pouches in the colon. It often presents no symptoms and is usually discovered incidentally. When these pouches become inflamed, the condition progresses to diverticulitis. Complications of diverticulitis can include the development of an abscess, perforation of the colon, or an abnormal fistula or passage.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Diverticulitis is common in Western countries, where it affects up to 50% of those over 60 years of age. It is becoming more common as the population ages. It is less common in Asia and Africa, where the diet tends to be higher in fiber.

**4. Etiology:**

The exact cause of diverticulitis is unknown, but it is thought that the diverticula become inflamed or infected as a result of stool or bacteria becoming trapped in the pouches. Risk factors include aging, obesity, smoking, lack of exercise, diet high in animal fat and low in fiber, and certain medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroids.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

The pathogenesis of diverticulitis is believed to involve erosion of the diverticular wall by increased intraluminal pressure or inspissated fecal material, leading to micro or macro perforation, with resultant pericolic inflammation, abscess formation, or peritonitis.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Other conditions that can mimic diverticulitis include colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal infection, and irritable bowel syndrome. Thus, these conditions should be ruled out while diagnosing diverticulitis.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

A low-fiber diet is a major risk factor for these conditions. Other factors include aging, obesity, smoking, lack of exercise, certain medications, and a high-fat diet.

**8. Previous Medical History:**

People with a history of diverticulosis are at risk of developing diverticulitis. Other risk factors include aging, obesity, smoking, lack of physical activity, and a diet high in animal fats and low in fiber. Certain drugs, including NSAIDs and steroids, may increase the risk of diverticulitis.
