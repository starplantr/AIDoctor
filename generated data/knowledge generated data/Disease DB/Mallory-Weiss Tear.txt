**Mallory-Weiss Tear**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

A Mallory-Weiss tear is a laceration in the mucous membrane at the junction of the esophagus and stomach, which can lead to upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Symptoms may include:
- Vomiting up blood, which might be bright red or have a coffee-grounds appearance
- Black, tarry bowel movements
- Lightheadedness or fainting (syncope), in severe cases
- Abdominal pain

**2. Natural History:**

The natural history of a Mallory-Weiss tear is usually self-limiting with spontaneous cessation of bleeding occurring in approximately 80-90% of patients. However, if the bleeding continues or is severe, medical or surgical intervention may be necessary.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Mallory-Weiss tears account for approximately 5-15% of all cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. It can occur at any age but is more common in middle-aged and older adults, particularly those with a history of chronic alcoholism.

**4. Etiology:**

The primary cause of a Mallory-Weiss tear is severe and prolonged vomiting. Other causes can include intense bouts of coughing, convulsions, or excessive straining during childbirth. Chronic alcoholism is a significant risk factor.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

The pathophysiology involves a rapid rise in intragastric pressure, as seen with vomiting, leading to a longitudinal tear at the gastroesophageal junction. The tear typically involves just the mucosa and submucosa and is usually less than 4 cm in length.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Differential diagnosis should include other causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding such as peptic ulcer disease, esophageal varices, gastric erosions or cancer, Dieulafoy's lesion, and aortoenteric fistula.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

Risk factors include anything that can cause excessive vomiting, such as alcoholism, bulimia, or chemotherapy. Other causes might include childbirth, severe coughing, or major trauma.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

Individuals with a history of disorders causing chronic or intense vomiting or coughing are at a higher risk. Also, those with a history of alcoholism or hiatal hernia may have increased risk. Peptic ulcer disease or the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or anticoagulants can exacerbate the bleeding associated with a Mallory-Weiss tear.
