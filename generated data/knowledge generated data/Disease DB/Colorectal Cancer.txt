**Colorectal Cancer**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

The symptoms of colorectal cancer can include:

- Changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation, or narrowing of the stool, that lasts for more than a few days
- Rectal bleeding or blood in the stool
- Persistent abdominal discomforts, such as cramps, gas, or pain
- A feeling that the bowel doesn't empty completely
- Weakness or fatigue
- Unexplained weight loss

Many people with colorectal cancer experience no symptoms in the early stages of the disease.

**2. Natural History:**

Colorectal cancer generally begins as a noncancerous growth called a polyp on the inner lining of the colon or rectum. Over time, some of these polyps can become colorectal cancers. The transition from normal tissue to cancer tissue follows a well-defined sequence known as the adenoma-carcinoma sequence.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the United States. The overall lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is about 1 in 23 for men and 1 in 25 for women. It is more common in developed countries and the risk increases with age, with more than 90% of cases diagnosed in individuals aged 50 and older.

**4. Etiology:**

Risk factors for colorectal cancer include:

- Age: The majority of cases are diagnosed in individuals over 50.
- Diet: A diet low in fiber and high in fat, calories, red meat, alcohol, and processed meats can increase the risk.
- Smoking and heavy alcohol use
- Obesity
- A personal or family history of colorectal cancer or polyps
- Certain inherited syndromes, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome.
- Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis)
- Type 2 diabetes

**5. Pathophysiology:**

Most colorectal cancers are adenocarcinomas, which originate from the glandular epithelial cells that line the colon and rectum. Genetic mutations, both inherited and acquired, play a significant role in the development of colorectal cancer. The most common pathway is the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, where a series of mutations in genes such as APC, KRAS, and TP53 leads to the transformation of normal colonic epithelium to adenomatous polyps and ultimately to invasive adenocarcinoma.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Differential diagnoses include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and other gastrointestinal malignancies. Infectious colitis, ischemic colitis, and diverticular disease may also present with similar symptoms.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

Risk factors include older age, a low-fiber and high-fat diet, a lack of regular physical activity, obesity, alcohol consumption, tobacco use, colorectal polyps, personal and family history of colorectal cancer or colorectal polyps, certain genetic syndromes, and inflammatory bowel disease.

**8. Previous Medical History:**

A previous history of colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps increases the risk of developing the disease again. Inflammatory

 bowel disease and certain inherited conditions like Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) also increase the risk. A family history of colorectal cancer in a first-degree relative can also increase risk.
