**Gastritis**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

The symptoms of gastritis vary among individuals, and many people with gastritis have no symptoms. However, common symptoms include:

- Upper abdominal pain or discomfort
- Nausea and vomiting
- A feeling of fullness in the upper abdomen after eating
- Indigestion
- Loss of appetite
- Hiccups
- Bloated feeling or gas
- Dark, tar-like stools or the presence of blood in the stool (sign of bleeding in the stomach)

**2. Natural History:**

Gastritis can be a brief and sudden illness (acute gastritis), a longer-lasting condition (chronic gastritis), or a special condition, perhaps as part of another medical illness (atrophic gastritis, autoimmune gastritis, eosinophilic gastritis). Acute gastritis usually resolves completely with timely treatment. Chronic gastritis may last from weeks to years if not treated. 

**3. Epidemiology:**

Gastritis is a common condition. The prevalence is variable among countries, with a higher prevalence in developing countries, mainly due to H. pylori infection. Acute gastritis is common in people of all ages, while chronic gastritis is more common in older adults.

**4. Etiology:**

Gastritis can be caused by various factors, including:

- Infection with Helicobacter pylori bacteria
- Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen
- Excessive alcohol consumption
- Stress due to severe illness, injury, or surgery
- Autoimmune disorders, where the immune system attacks healthy cells in the stomach lining
- Other diseases and conditions, like HIV/AIDS, Crohn's disease, and parasitic infections

**5. Pathophysiology:**

Gastritis is characterized by inflammation and damage to the stomach lining. This can be due to an imbalance between the protective factors (such as mucus and bicarbonate) and the damaging factors (such as acid, pepsin, and H. pylori). In chronic gastritis, continuous inflammation can eventually lead to atrophy of the stomach lining and even gastric cancer.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Conditions with similar symptoms to gastritis include:

- Peptic ulcer disease
- Gallstones or gallbladder disease
- Gastroenteritis
- Gastric cancer
- GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

Factors like regular use of certain pain relievers (like NSAIDs), heavy alcohol consumption, stress, and bacterial infection (H.pylori) can lead to gastritis. Additionally, older age and autoimmune disorders are risk factors.

**8. Previous Medical History:**

A history of H. pylori infection or autoimmune disorders can predispose an individual to gastritis. Other factors that can increase the risk include chronic vomiting, excessive alcohol consumption, and the use of NSAIDs or other drugs that can irritate the stomach lining.
