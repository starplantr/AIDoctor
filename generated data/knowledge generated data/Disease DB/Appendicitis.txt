**Appendicitis**

Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a small pouch that is attached to the beginning of the large intestine.

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

The classic symptoms of appendicitis include:

- Dull pain near the navel or the upper abdomen that becomes sharp as it moves to the lower right abdomen. This is usually the first sign.
- Loss of appetite
- Nausea and/or vomiting soon after abdominal pain begins
- Abdominal swelling
- Fever of 99-102 degrees Fahrenheit
- Inability to pass gas

**2. Natural History:**

Untreated appendicitis can progress to perforation of the appendix within 24 to 72 hours, leading to peritonitis, an inflammation of the lining of the abdomen, which can be life-threatening. After treatment, which usually involves surgical removal of the appendix, most patients recover without complications.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Appendicitis is one of the most common causes of severe abdominal pain requiring surgery. It can occur at any age but most often occurs in people between the ages of 10 and 30. 

**4. Etiology:**

The cause of appendicitis relates to blockage of the inside of the appendix, known as the lumen. The blockage leads to increased pressure, impaired blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, gangrene and rupture (breaking or tearing) of the appendix can result.

Blockages may be the result of build-up of thick mucus within the appendix or to stool that enters the appendix from the cecum. The bacterium can multiply rapidly, causing the appendix to become inflamed, swollen and filled with pus, and ultimately leading to appendicitis.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

When the appendix gets blocked, bacteria within the appendix begin to multiply. This leads to the formation of pus and swelling, which causes pain. The increased pressure can lead to compromise of the blood supply to the wall of the appendix (ischemia), which can cause the appendix to die (gangrene). Eventually, the appendix can burst or perforate. This can lead to a serious, widespread infection of the abdomen (peritonitis).

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Conditions that may present similarly to appendicitis and need to be differentiated include:

- Ectopic pregnancy
- Ovarian torsion
- Gastroenteritis
- Kidney stones
- Urinary tract infection
- Gallbladder disease
- Crohn's disease

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

This is most often caused by a blockage of the inside of the appendix. Risk factors are not well understood, but it seems to be more common in males and people aged 10-30.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

While there is no direct association between certain medical histories and the development of appendicitis, conditions that can mimic its symptoms include previous abdominal surgery, gynecologic disorders, or gastrointestinal diseases. Furthermore, a history of gastrointestinal disorders could potentially increase the risk of developing appendicitis.
