**Gastric Cancer**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Gastric cancer, also known as stomach cancer, can present with a variety of symptoms, which may include:

- Unintended weight loss
- Abdominal pain or discomfort, especially in the upper abdomen
- Indigestion, heartburn or acid reflux
- Loss of appetite
- Feeling full quickly during meals
- Nausea or vomiting, with or without blood
- Swelling or fluid build-up in the abdomen
- Anemia or fatigue
- Difficulty swallowing (in advanced cases)

It's important to note that these symptoms can also be associated with many other less serious conditions.

**2. Natural History:**

Gastric cancer typically evolves over many years in a stepwise progression. It often starts with a precancerous condition such as chronic gastritis, progresses to atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and then carcinoma. The disease may remain asymptomatic for a long time until it progresses to advanced stages.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Gastric cancer is the fifth most common malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. It's more common in older adults, with most people diagnosed in their late 60s or 70s. The incidence varies significantly worldwide, with the highest rates in East Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America, and the lowest rates in North America and Africa.

**4. Etiology:**

Several risk factors contribute to the development of gastric cancer, including:

- Helicobacter pylori infection: This is the most significant risk factor, associated with about 75% of all gastric cancers worldwide.
- Diet: Consumption of smoked, pickled, or poorly preserved foods; a diet high in salt; and low intake of fruits and vegetables have been associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer.
- Smoking: This doubles the risk of gastric cancer.
- Certain health conditions: These include chronic gastritis, pernicious anemia, gastric polyps, and certain inherited conditions such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

The pathogenesis of gastric cancer is complex and involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It begins with an initial mucosal injury (often due to H. pylori infection), leading to chronic inflammation and a cycle of tissue damage and repair, eventually resulting in changes in the gastric mucosa (atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia), and finally, carcinoma.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Conditions that may present with similar symptoms include gastric ulcer, gastric lymphoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), chronic gastritis, and non-ulcer dyspepsia. 

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

Risk factors include infection with H.pylori, long-term stomach inflammation and gastritis, smoking, certain dietary factors (high in smoked and pickled foods, and low in fruits and vegetables), older age, certain genetic conditions, and having a family history of gastric cancer.

**8. Previous Medical History:**

Previous medical history related to gastric cancer includes H. pylori infection, chronic gastritis, gastric ulcers, or gastric polyps. Those with a family history of gastric cancer or hereditary cancer syndromes such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are also at increased risk.
