**Liver Cancer**

Liver cancer is a type of malignancy that originates in the cells of the liver. The most common type of liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Symptoms may not appear in the early stages of liver cancer, but as the disease progresses, symptoms may include:

- Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
- Abdominal pain, particularly in the upper right part of the abdomen
- Swelling in the abdomen
- Unexplained weight loss
- Loss of appetite and feeling full after a small meal
- Nausea and vomiting
- General fatigue
- White, chalky stools

**2. Natural History:**

Liver cancer usually develops over years and is typically preceded by cirrhosis, a scarring of the liver, or chronic hepatitis infections. Once developed, it often progresses quickly, leading to liver failure, unless detected early and treated.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Liver cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. It is more common in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. It is more common in males than females.

**4. Etiology:**

Major risk factors for liver cancer include:

- Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV)
- Cirrhosis: Scarring of the liver usually caused by chronic alcohol abuse or hepatitis infections
- Certain inherited liver diseases
- Diabetes
- Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
- Exposure to aflatoxins, a fungus found in certain foods like peanuts and corn
- Excessive alcohol consumption

**5. Pathophysiology:**

Liver cancer usually arises in the context of chronic liver inflammation caused by viral infections or alcohol abuse. This inflammation leads to DNA damage, abnormal cell growth, and tumor development. 

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

The differential diagnosis for liver cancer may include:

- Metastatic cancer to the liver: Many cancers can spread to the liver, and it is more common than primary liver cancer.
- Hepatitis
- Cirrhosis
- Hemangioma or other liver cysts
- Focal nodular hyperplasia
- Hepatic adenoma

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

Chronic infection with Hepatitis B or C and cirrhosis of the liver are major risk factors. Other risk factors can include heavy alcohol use, obesity, type 2 diabetes, certain rare genetic conditions, and exposure to aflatoxins (a type of fungus).

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

A history of chronic hepatitis B or C infection, cirrhosis of the liver, or familial liver diseases significantly increases the risk of developing liver cancer. Similarly, a history of excessive alcohol consumption or obesity, both of which can lead to cirrhosis, also pose a risk. Aflatoxin exposure is also a risk factor for the disease.
