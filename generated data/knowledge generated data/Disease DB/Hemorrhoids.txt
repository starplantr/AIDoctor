**Hemorrhoids**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Hemorrhoids can be internal (inside the rectum) or external (under the skin around the anus), and the symptoms vary accordingly. Common symptoms include:

- Painless bleeding during bowel movements, which might manifest as bright red blood on toilet paper or in the toilet bowl
- Itching or irritation in the anal region
- Pain or discomfort
- Swelling around the anus
- A lump near the anus, which may be sensitive or painful (may be a thrombosed hemorrhoid)
- Leakage of feces

**2. Natural History:**

Hemorrhoids are chronic and tend to flare up periodically and then diminish. Over time, the symptoms can worsen due to further stretching and sagging of the supportive tissue in the rectum and anus. While hemorrhoids can cause discomfort and bleeding, they do not threaten one's health and can typically be managed with lifestyle modifications and non-surgical treatments. In severe cases, surgical intervention may be necessary.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Hemorrhoids are a common condition, affecting both men and women. They can occur at any age but are more common in adults aged 45 to 65. Pregnant women are also at an increased risk.

**4. Etiology:**

Factors that can increase the pressure in the lower rectum and lead to hemorrhoids include:

- Straining during bowel movements
- Sitting for long periods, especially on the toilet
- Chronic constipation or diarrhea
- Obesity
- Pregnancy
- Low-fiber diet
- Anal intercourse
- Aging, as the tissues can weaken and stretch

**5. Pathophysiology:**

Hemorrhoids are primarily associated with increased pressure in the hemorrhoidal venous plexus, leading to swelling and distension of the vessels. Over time, the supporting tissues in the rectum and anus can become stretched and weakened, causing the hemorrhoids to protrude.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Other conditions that can present with similar symptoms to hemorrhoids include:

- Anal fissures
- Anal abscess or fistula
- Rectal prolapse
- Anal or rectal cancer
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Gastrointestinal bleeding from other causes

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

Chronic constipation or diarrhea, a low-fiber diet, lack of physical activity, pregnancy, and aging can contribute to the development of hemorrhoids. Straining during bowel movements and sitting on the toilet for long periods also increase risk.

**8. Previous Medical History:**

A history of chronic constipation, prolonged straining during bowel movements, or a family history of hemorrhoids can increase the risk of developing this condition. Other factors include aging, obesity, and pregnancy.
