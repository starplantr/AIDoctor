**Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

The symptoms of IBS vary but can include:

- Abdominal pain or cramping that is often relieved by passing a bowel movement
- Changes in bowel habits â€” such as diarrhea, constipation, or both alternately, often with a sense of incomplete bowel movement
- Excess gas
- Mucus in the stool
- Bloating
- Food intolerance

Some people may also have sexual problems and urinary symptoms, such as frequency, urgency, and discomfort.

**2. Natural History:**

IBS is a chronic condition that needs long-term management. The course of IBS is highly variable, and it often includes periods of increased symptoms, or flare-ups, and periods of remission. The symptoms might change over time. While IBS can cause significant discomfort, it does not lead to serious complications, like cancer.

**3. Epidemiology:**

IBS is a common disorder, affecting 10-15% of the population worldwide. It is more common in women than in men and often begins in early adulthood.

**4. Etiology:**

The exact cause of IBS isn't known. It's believed to be due to a combination of factors, including:

- Abnormal gastrointestinal (GI) motility: This can cause the bowel to contract too much or not enough.
- Visceral hypersensitivity: People with IBS often have an increased sensitivity to abdominal pain.
- Post-infectious IBS: IBS can develop after a severe bout of diarrhea (gastroenteritis) caused by bacteria or a virus.
- Changes in gut microbiota: These are the 'good' bacteria in the gut.
- Brain-gut interactions: Psychological stress can affect functioning of the GI tract.
- Genetic factors: IBS can run in families.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

The pathophysiology of IBS is complex and not fully understood. It is thought to involve multiple factors, including abnormal GI motility, visceral hypersensitivity, inflammation, bacterial overgrowth, alterations in gut microbiota, and dysfunction in the brain-gut axis. These factors can lead to changes in how the brain and gut interact, resulting in the symptoms of IBS.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

The differential diagnosis for IBS includes conditions that present with similar symptoms, such as:

- Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis)
- Celiac disease
- Food intolerances or allergies
- Gastroenteritis
- Diverticulitis
- Colorectal cancer

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

Stress and certain foods (like those high in FODMAPs - Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols) can trigger IBS symptoms. A sedentary lifestyle, certain medications, and irregular eating habits may also contribute. There seems to be a hereditary component as well, indicating a possible genetic predisposition.

**8. Previous Medical History:**

Previous GI infections can increase the risk of developing IBS. A history of physical or sexual abuse or other traumatic experiences can also increase susceptibility to IBS, as can a family history of the disorder.
