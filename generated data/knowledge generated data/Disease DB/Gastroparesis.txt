**Gastroparesis**

Gastroparesis is a condition that affects the stomach muscles and results in slow emptying of food from the stomach to the small intestine.

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Symptoms of gastroparesis can range from mild to severe and often include:
- Nausea
- Vomiting (especially of undigested food)
- Abdominal bloating
- Early satiety (feeling full after eating only a small amount)
- Unintentional weight loss
- Heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux
- Changes in blood glucose levels
- Lack of appetite

**2. Natural History:**

Gastroparesis is a chronic condition. Symptoms may fluctuate over time and can vary in intensity. It can significantly affect quality of life but is not generally life-threatening.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Gastroparesis affects about 4% of the population in the United States, with women being disproportionately affected. The prevalence is likely underestimated due to misdiagnosis and the overlap of symptoms with other gastrointestinal disorders.

**4. Etiology:**

The most common known cause of gastroparesis is diabetes, which can damage the vagus nerve that controls the stomach muscles. Other causes include surgery on the stomach or vagus nerve and certain medications like opioids and some antidepressants. However, in many cases, the cause is unknown (idiopathic gastroparesis).

**5. Pathophysiology:**

In gastroparesis, the motility of the stomach is impaired, either due to a problem with the stomach muscles, the nerves controlling these muscles, or both. This results in delayed emptying of the stomach's contents into the small intestine.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Gastroparesis symptoms can mimic other conditions, including:
- Peptic ulcer disease
- Gastric outlet obstruction
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
- Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

Diabetes is a common underlying cause. Other factors can include certain medications, abdominal or esophageal surgery, infection, hypothyroidism, nervous system diseases like Parkinson's or multiple sclerosis, and certain psychological conditions.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

A history of diabetes, abdominal or vagus nerve surgery, or certain neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease can increase the risk of developing gastroparesis. Also, certain medications, especially those that slow gastric emptying or nerve conduction, are associated with gastroparesis.
