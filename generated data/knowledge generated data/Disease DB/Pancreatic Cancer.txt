**Pancreatic Cancer**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Pancreatic cancer often doesn't show symptoms in the early stages. Symptoms that may occur as the disease progresses include:
- Unintentional weight loss
- Loss of appetite
- Abdominal pain that radiates to the back
- Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes)
- Dark urine
- Light-colored or greasy stools
- Itchy skin
- New-onset diabetes
- Blood clots

**2. Natural History:**

Pancreatic cancer is typically aggressive, with few symptoms until the cancer has advanced and prognosis is poor. Without treatment, patients may only live a few months after diagnosis. Even with treatment, the overall 5-year survival rate is low.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Pancreatic cancer represents about 3% of all cancers in the United States and about 7% of all cancer deaths. The average age at the time of diagnosis is 70. Men are slightly more likely to develop pancreatic cancer than women.

**4. Etiology:**

The exact cause of pancreatic cancer is unknown. However, certain risk factors are associated with the disease, including smoking, obesity, age, family history of pancreatic cancer or pancreatitis, and certain inherited gene mutations.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

Pancreatic cancer begins when abnormal cells within the pancreas grow out of control. These cells continue living when normal cells would die, accumulating to form a tumor. Most pancreatic cancers are exocrine cancers (pancreatic adenocarcinomas). Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), which are less common, often have a better prognosis.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Differential diagnosis for pancreatic cancer can include chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cysts, pancreatic pseudocyst, and other intra-abdominal malignancies.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

Risk factors include tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes, and certain types of inherited genetic syndromes. Chronic pancreatitis and a family history of pancreatic cancer can also increase risk.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

Certain genetic syndromes, including BRCA2 gene mutation, Lynch syndrome, and familial atypical mole-malignant melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome, can increase the risk of pancreatic cancer. Chronic pancreatitis and diabetes may also increase risk. A family history of pancreatic cancer, especially in a parent, sibling, or child, can double the risk of developing this disease.
