**Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis is a chronic, progressive disease that leads to inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts inside and outside the liver. The main symptoms of PSC can include:
- Fatigue
- Itching (pruritus)
- Yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)
- Abdominal pain
- Fever
- Enlarged liver
- Unexplained weight loss

**2. Natural History:**

The natural history of PSC is highly variable. It is a slowly progressive disease, and many patients may remain asymptomatic for years. Over time, it can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma).

**3. Epidemiology:**

PSC is a rare disease, affecting about 6-16 individuals per 100,000 in the western world. It is more common in men than women and often diagnosed between ages 30 and 40. 

**4. Etiology:**

The exact cause of PSC is unknown. It's thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is also associated with inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

The pathogenesis of PSC is not entirely understood. It's thought to involve chronic inflammation of the bile ducts, leading to fibrosis (scarring), narrowing of the ducts, and impaired bile flow (cholestasis). Over time, this can result in progressive liver damage, cirrhosis, and possibly liver failure.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Differential diagnosis should include other causes of liver diseases and cholestasis, such as primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis, choledocholithiasis, and cholangiocarcinoma.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

This is often associated with inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis. Other potential risk factors include a history of bacterial or viral infections, toxic exposure, and genetic predisposition.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

A notable proportion of people with PSC have a history of inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis. Also, a family history of PSC or other autoimmune conditions can increase the risk. The presence of other autoimmune conditions may be relevant as well.
