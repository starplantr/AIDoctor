**Ischemic Colitis**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Ischemic colitis typically presents with sudden onset abdominal pain and tenderness, often on the left side. It is frequently accompanied by an urgent need to defecate, and passage of bright red blood or bloody diarrhea. 

**2. Natural History:**

Most cases of ischemic colitis are transient and resolve within 1-2 weeks. However, some patients may experience chronic ischemic colitis, which can lead to long-term changes in bowel habits, recurrent bloody stools, and weight loss. Severe cases can result in bowel necrosis and require surgical intervention.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Ischemic colitis is the most common form of intestinal ischemia, accounting for over 50% of cases. It's more common in older adults (60 years and above), but it can occur at any age. The incidence is slightly higher in females.

**4. Etiology:**

Ischemic colitis is usually caused by a temporary or permanent reduction in blood flow (ischemia) to the colon, often due to blocked or narrowed blood vessels. Conditions that can cause this include atherosclerosis, low blood pressure/shock, and certain diseases such as diabetes and lupus. Certain medications, like diuretics, heart medications, and migraine treatments, can also contribute to the development of ischemic colitis.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

Ischemic colitis occurs when blood flow to the colon is reduced, usually due to occlusion or narrowing of the arteries that supply it. This reduction in blood flow can lead to inflammation and injury to the colon. If the blood flow is not restored, it can cause the affected part of the colon to die (necrosis).

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

The differential diagnosis for ischemic colitis includes other causes of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), infectious colitis, diverticulitis, and colorectal cancer.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

This condition is often associated with atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), heart disease or arrhythmias, low blood pressure, certain types of surgery, certain medications, and dehydration.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

Previous history of cardiovascular disease, particularly atherosclerosis, can increase the risk for ischemic colitis. Other risk factors include age over 60, diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, renal failure, and certain medications such as diuretics and those that can cause constipation. Conditions that increase blood clotting (like certain heart rhythms, clotting disorders, or recent surgeries) also increase risk.
