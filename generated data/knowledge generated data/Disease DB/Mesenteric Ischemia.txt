**Mesenteric Ischemia**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) presents with sudden severe abdominal pain out of proportion to physical findings, often associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) usually presents with postprandial abdominal pain (intestinal angina), leading to food aversion and significant weight loss.

**2. Natural History:**

Without treatment, AMI can progress to bowel infarction, sepsis, and death. CMI, while typically not life-threatening, can significantly affect quality of life and may progress to AMI.

**3. Epidemiology:**

AMI accounts for about 0.1% of all hospital admissions but its mortality rate remains high (60-80%). CMI is less common, mostly affecting people over 60. It is more common in women and those with cardiovascular risk factors.

**4. Etiology:**

Mesenteric ischemia can be due to decreased blood flow caused by blockage (such as a blood clot) or narrowing (stenosis) in one or more of the mesenteric arteries or veins. It can be acute or chronic. The most common cause of AMI is embolic occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. CMI usually results from atherosclerosis.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

Ischemia occurs when the demand for oxygen in the intestines exceeds supply, most commonly due to blockage of the mesenteric vessels. Over time, ischemia can lead to necrosis and perforation of the intestinal wall, causing bacterial translocation and sepsis.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Differential diagnoses include other causes of acute abdominal pain such as appendicitis, peptic ulcer disease, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, and bowel obstruction. For CMI, other causes of postprandial abdominal pain should be considered, including peptic ulcer disease and gallbladder disease.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

Risk factors include age over 60, a history of heart disease or heart attack, arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

Prior cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, heart failure, or procedures that can cause embolism (like cardiac catheterization) can increase the risk for mesenteric ischemia. Chronic conditions such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are also risk factors. For venous mesenteric ischemia, conditions leading to hypercoagulability such as malignancy, recent surgery, or use of oral contraceptives should be considered.
