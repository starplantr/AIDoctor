**Esophageal Cancer**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Early esophageal cancer often does not cause symptoms. However, as the cancer grows, symptoms may include:
- Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
- Unexplained weight loss
- Chest pain, pressure, or burning
- Worsening indigestion or heartburn
- Coughing or hoarseness

**2. Natural History:**

Esophageal cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage because it frequently does not cause symptoms until the disease has progressed. Survival rates for esophageal cancer are generally low. 

**3. Epidemiology:**

Esophageal cancer is not common in the United States. It occurs most often in men over the age of 50. There are two main types of esophageal cancer: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type worldwide, whereas adenocarcinoma is more common in the US.

**4. Etiology:**

Risk factors include tobacco and heavy alcohol use, older age, being male, having certain esophageal diseases (like Barrett's esophagus), obesity, and certain dietary factors.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

Esophageal cancer starts in the cells of the esophagus's inner layer and grows outward into the other layers. Adenocarcinoma typically starts in the cells of mucus-secreting glands in the esophagus and is commonly found in the lower part of the esophagus, near the stomach. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from the cells that line the surface of the esophagus.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Other conditions that can cause similar symptoms include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), esophageal stricture, achalasia, esophagitis, or benign esophageal tumors.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

Risk factors include smoking, heavy drinking, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a diet low in fruits and vegetables, being overweight or obese, and certain conditions affecting the esophagus like achalasia or Barrett's esophagus.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

A history of certain diseases can increase the risk of esophageal cancer. These include Barrett's esophagus, achalasia, tylosis, and Plummer-Vinson syndrome. Long-standing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can also increase risk.
