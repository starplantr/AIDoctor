**Functional Dyspepsia**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Functional dyspepsia, also known as non-ulcer dyspepsia or indigestion, is characterized by chronic or recurrent pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen. Unlike IBS, symptoms are not related to the process of defecation. There's no evidence of organic disease or structural abnormality seen on endoscopy. Symptoms of functional dyspepsia can include:

- Feeling full sooner than expected when eating
- Discomfort or a burning sensation in the upper abdomen
- Bloating in the upper abdomen
- Nausea
- Belching

**2. Natural History:**

Functional dyspepsia is a chronic disorder with symptoms that can wax and wane over time. Some patients may experience periods of symptom relief. However, for most patients, dyspepsia is a chronic ailment. A significant proportion of individuals with dyspepsia will have long-term persistence of symptoms.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Functional dyspepsia is a common disorder with an estimated prevalence of 10-20% in the general population worldwide. It affects both sexes and all ages, although it is more common in women and younger adults.

**4. Etiology:**

The exact cause of functional dyspepsia is unknown. It's believed that the condition may be related to several factors:

- Abnormal motility in the stomach or small intestine
- Sensitivity to acid
- Altered perception of gut sensations
- Psychosocial factors

**5. Pathophysiology:**

Functional dyspepsia is thought to arise due to a complex interplay of pathophysiological mechanisms, including impaired gastric accommodation to a meal, delayed gastric emptying, hypersensitivity to gastric distention, and central nervous system dysfunction.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Other conditions that need to be ruled out when diagnosing functional dyspepsia include:

- Peptic ulcer disease
- Gastritis or gastroparesis
- Gallstones
- Chronic pancreatitis
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
- Stomach cancer

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor**

There is no known cause for functional dyspepsia, however, certain dietary habits (spicy or fatty foods, caffeine, alcohol), smoking, and stress might exacerbate the symptoms.

**8. Previous Medical History:**

Functional dyspepsia often has no identifiable cause. However, some factors may increase the risk, including:

- Past history of bacterial infection, such as Helicobacter pylori
- Certain medications, including aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can lead to peptic ulcers
- Age: While functional dyspepsia can occur at any age, it's more common in older adults.
- Stress, anxiety, or depression: These psychological issues may increase the risk of functional dyspepsia.
