**Achalasia**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Achalasia presents with difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), regurgitation of undigested food, chest pain, weight loss, and occasionally, coughing at night. The dysphagia typically occurs with both solids and liquids, and tends to progressively worsen over time.

**2. Natural History:**

Achalasia is a chronic, progressive disorder. The course of the disease varies, but most patients will experience progressive difficulty in swallowing and worsening regurgitation over time. Treatment can help manage symptoms, but there's no cure for achalasia.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Achalasia is relatively rare, with an estimated incidence of approximately 1 per 100,000 individuals per year. It affects men and women equally and can occur at any age, but it's more commonly diagnosed in middle-aged or older adults.

**4. Etiology:**

The exact cause of achalasia is unknown. It's thought to occur when the nerves in the esophagus become damaged, leading to a failure of the esophageal muscles and the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to function properly. Some theories suggest a viral cause, and there is also a rare familial form suggesting a genetic component.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

In achalasia, the loss of inhibitory ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus of the esophagus leads to a failure of relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, and a lack of peristalsis in the esophageal body. This results in the classic symptoms of dysphagia and regurgitation.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis include esophageal cancer, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), esophageal stricture, and other motility disorders such as diffuse esophageal spasm and nutcracker esophagus.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

This condition is caused by damage to the nerves of the esophagus, though the exact reason for this damage is unknown. It may be related to an autoimmune condition or infection.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

There is no known previous medical history linked to the development of achalasia. It can coexist with autoimmune conditions, but it is not clear if there is a direct correlation.
