**Hiatal Hernia**

A hiatal hernia occurs when part of your stomach pushes upward through your diaphragm, which is a large muscle separating your abdomen and chest.

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

A small hiatal hernia often doesn't cause problems, and you may never know you have a hiatal hernia unless your doctor discovers it when checking for another condition. But a large hiatal hernia can allow food and acid to back up into your esophagus, leading to heartburn, chest pain, belching, and nausea.

**2. Natural History:**

A hiatal hernia can be a congenital condition present from birth, or it can develop over many years later in life. Hiatal hernias do not resolve by themselves and tend to gradually increase in size over time. The progression of symptoms may be slow, and the severity of symptoms often correlates with the size of the hernia.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Hiatal hernias are most common in people who are 50 or older and obese. The exact prevalence is not known as many people with hiatal hernia are asymptomatic. Some estimates suggest that up to 60% of people aged 50 or older may have a hiatal hernia.

**4. Etiology:**

The exact cause of many hiatal hernias isn't known. In some people, injury or other damage may weaken muscle tissue. This makes it possible for your stomach to push through your diaphragm. Other causes include consistent pressure on surrounding muscles, such as coughing, vomiting, straining during a bowel movement, exercise, or lifting heavy objects.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

The diaphragm has a small opening (hiatus) through which the food tube (esophagus) passes before connecting to the stomach. In a hiatal hernia, the stomach bulges up into the chest through that opening. The cause of hiatal hernias is not entirely understood, but a weakening of the diaphragm with age or pressure on the abdomen could play a role.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Conditions that may present similarly and need to be differentiated from a hiatal hernia include:

- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
- Peptic ulcer disease
- Angina or myocardial infarction
- Gallbladder disease

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

Risk factors include age over 50, obesity, and smoking. In some cases, increased pressure in the abdomen from coughing, straining during bowel movements, pregnancy and delivery, or substantial weight gain may contribute.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

Those with a history of conditions that increase the pressure in the abdomen, such as obesity, pregnancy, and constipation, may have an increased risk of developing a hiatal hernia. Prior surgeries or injuries to the diaphragm area can also increase the risk.
