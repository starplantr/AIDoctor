**Hepatitis A, B, and C**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Symptoms are often similar for hepatitis A, B, and C, although the severity and duration may vary. Common symptoms include:

- Fatigue
- Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
- Dark urine
- Pale-colored stools
- Abdominal pain or discomfort
- Loss of appetite
- Nausea and vomiting
- Joint pain
- Low-grade fever

**2. Natural History:**

Hepatitis A: It is an acute infection that usually resolves on its own within 2 months. It does not progress to a chronic state.

Hepatitis B: It can be an acute or chronic infection. Acute hepatitis B infection may resolve within 6 months, while chronic hepatitis B can persist for years and may lead to liver damage or liver cancer.

Hepatitis C: Most people with hepatitis C develop a chronic infection, which can result in long-term liver damage, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Hepatitis A: Common in regions with poor sanitation and hygiene. It is often transmitted through contaminated food or water.

Hepatitis B: Prevalent worldwide, but most common in Asia, Africa, and the Western Pacific. It is transmitted through contact with infected blood, sexual contact, or from mother to child during childbirth.

Hepatitis C: Most prevalent in low-income countries, particularly in Africa and Central Asia. It is primarily transmitted through contaminated blood, such as through blood transfusions or sharing needles.

**4. Etiology:**

Hepatitis A: Caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). It is transmitted through the fecal-oral route.

Hepatitis B: Caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It is transmitted through contact with infected blood, semen, or other bodily fluids.

Hepatitis C: Caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). It is transmitted through contact with infected blood, most often through needle sharing or unsafe medical procedures.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

Hepatitis A, B, and C are all viral infections that cause inflammation of the liver. The viruses replicate in liver cells, causing cellular damage and an immune response that leads to liver inflammation. Prolonged inflammation may result in fibrosis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Conditions that can present with similar symptoms include other forms of hepatitis (D, E), alcoholic hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These conditions should be ruled out during diagnosis.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

Hepatitis A is primarily spread through contaminated food or water. Hepatitis B and C are primarily spread through blood and body fluids. High-risk behaviors include unsafe sex, intravenous drug use, and sharing personal items like razors or toothbrushes. Certain occupations, international travel, and alcoholism are other potential risk factors.

**8. Previous Medical History:**

People with a history of intravenous drug use, unprotected sex, or blood transfusions are at higher risk for hepatitis B and C. Individuals with a history of travel to areas with high hepatitis A prevalence, or those who work in

 healthcare or childcare, may be at increased risk for hepatitis A. Those with chronic liver disease are more susceptible to severe illness if they contract any form of hepatitis.
