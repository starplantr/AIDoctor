**Esophageal Varices**

Esophageal varices are abnormally enlarged veins in the esophagus, typically resulting from liver cirrhosis.

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Most individuals with esophageal varices may not present with symptoms until they rupture, which is a medical emergency. When they do rupture, symptoms include:

- Vomiting of blood, often in large amounts
- Black, tarry, or bloody stools
- Lightheadedness
- Loss of consciousness (in severe cases)

**2. Natural History:**

The progression of esophageal varices is closely related to the severity of liver disease. In individuals with cirrhosis, esophageal varices develop at a rate of about 7% per year. If left untreated, the risk of bleeding is about 30% within two years of diagnosis. Bleeding esophageal varices are a severe complication and are associated with a high mortality rate.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Esophageal varices are most commonly seen in individuals with liver disease, especially cirrhosis. It is estimated that about 50% of people with cirrhosis develop esophageal varices.

**4. Etiology:**

The primary cause of esophageal varices is portal hypertension, typically due to liver cirrhosis. Other causes can include blood clots in the portal vein (portal vein thrombosis) or a parasitic infection called schistosomiasis.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

Esophageal varices form when blood flow to the liver is obstructed by scar tissue in the case of cirrhosis or a blood clot. This causes the blood to flow into smaller vessels that are not designed to carry large volumes of blood. The vessels can leak blood or even rupture, leading to a potentially life-threatening situation.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Other causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding should be considered, including:

- Gastric varices
- Peptic ulcer disease
- Gastritis
- Esophagitis
- Mallory-Weiss tear

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

These are typically a consequence of liver cirrhosis, as the disease causes high blood pressure in the veins that supply the liver. Alcohol abuse, viral hepatitis, and anything else that can cause liver disease can also contribute to the development of esophageal varices.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

A history of liver disease, especially cirrhosis, greatly increases the risk of esophageal varices. Other conditions leading to portal hypertension can also be associated. A history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding may be a sign of previously unrecognized esophageal varices.
