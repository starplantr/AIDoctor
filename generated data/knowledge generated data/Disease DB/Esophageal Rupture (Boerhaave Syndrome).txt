**Esophageal Rupture (Boerhaave Syndrome)**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Esophageal rupture, specifically Boerhaave syndrome, is a rare but life-threatening condition. Symptoms often start with severe vomiting followed by intense chest pain. Other symptoms can include:

- Severe abdominal pain
- Difficulty swallowing or complete inability to swallow
- Shortness of breath
- Rapid heart rate
- Low blood pressure
- Fever
- Neck pain or swelling

**2. Natural History:**

Boerhaave syndrome is an acute condition that requires immediate medical attention. If left untreated, it can rapidly progress to shock and death. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, patients can recover, but the condition often leaves significant long-term health impacts due to the potential for additional complications such as abscesses, mediastinitis, and sepsis.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Boerhaave syndrome is rare, with an estimated incidence of about 3.1 per 1,000,000 people per year. It's more common in males and typically presents in the middle-aged and older population.

**4. Etiology:**

Boerhaave syndrome is typically caused by a sudden increase in intra-esophageal pressure combined with negative intrathoracic pressure, usually due to forceful or prolonged vomiting. This pressure difference can lead to a spontaneous tear in the esophagus.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

The increase in intra-esophageal pressure and the sudden decrease in intrathoracic pressure leads to a longitudinal tear, typically in the lower third of the esophagus. This tear allows air and gastric contents to enter the mediastinum and pleural space, leading to mediastinitis and potentially pleural effusions or pneumothorax.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

The differential diagnosis for Boerhaave syndrome includes other conditions that cause severe chest or abdominal pain, such as acute myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, and perforated peptic ulcer.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

This is usually the result of forceful or long-term vomiting or retching. Other causes can include trauma, certain medical procedures, and the presence of a tumor.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

A history of conditions that can lead to severe vomiting, such as gastrointestinal disorders, alcoholism, or eating disorders, may increase the risk of Boerhaave syndrome. Additionally, any condition that weakens the esophageal tissue could potentially increase the risk of rupture.
