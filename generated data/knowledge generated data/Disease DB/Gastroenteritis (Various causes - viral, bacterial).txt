**Gastroenteritis (Various causes - viral, bacterial)**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Gastroenteritis, also known as infectious diarrhea, is characterized by the inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, including both the stomach and the small intestine. Symptoms may include:

- Diarrhea
- Nausea and vomiting
- Abdominal pain and cramping
- Fever
- Loss of appetite
- Dehydration symptoms such as dry mouth, feeling thirsty, decreased urine output, dark yellow urine, and feeling dizzy or light-headed.

**2. Natural History:**

Gastroenteritis is typically an acute illness that tends to resolve on its own within a few days to a week, depending on the causative organism. However, in some cases, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, the elderly, and young children, it can cause severe dehydration and require hospitalization.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Gastroenteritis affects people worldwide, with viral causes being the most common. It's one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among young children globally, particularly in developing countries where access to clean water and sanitation is limited. It's also common in developed countries, often spreading in closed environments such as schools, childcare centers, and nursing homes.

**4. Etiology:**

Gastroenteritis can be caused by a variety of organisms, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites. The most common causes include:

- Viruses: Norovirus and rotavirus are the most common viral causes. Other viruses include adenovirus and astrovirus.
- Bacteria: Common bacterial causes include Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Bacterial gastroenteritis can also be caused by Clostridium difficile, particularly in individuals who have been using antibiotics.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

In gastroenteritis, the offending organism enters the body, typically through the oral route, and causes inflammation and damage to the lining of the stomach and intestines. This results in increased secretion and reduced absorption of fluids and electrolytes, leading to watery diarrhea. Vomiting may occur due to inflammation and irritation of the stomach lining.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Conditions that may present with similar symptoms include food poisoning, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, lactose intolerance, and appendicitis. It's important to differentiate these conditions from gastroenteritis during diagnosis.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

This is usually caused by viral or bacterial infection. Risk factors include poor sanitation, close contact with someone who has the virus, a weakened immune system, and consuming contaminated food or water.

**8. Previous Medical History:**

Individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or those on immunosuppressive medications, are at higher risk of gastroenteritis and may experience more severe disease. Those with previous gastrointestinal surgery or chronic gastrointestinal diseases may also be at increased risk. Recent antibiotic use can increase the risk of C.
