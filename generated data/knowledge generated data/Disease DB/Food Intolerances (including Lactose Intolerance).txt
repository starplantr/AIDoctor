**Food Intolerances (including Lactose Intolerance)**

Food intolerances, sometimes referred to as food sensitivities, occur when a person has difficulty digesting a particular type of food, which can lead to symptoms such as intestinal gas, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Lactose intolerance is a common type of food intolerance.

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Symptoms of food intolerances can vary greatly and may include:

- Nausea
- Stomach pain
- Gas, cramps, or bloating
- Vomiting
- Heartburn
- Diarrhea
- Headaches
- Irritability or nervousness

In the case of lactose intolerance, symptoms specifically occur after consuming lactose-containing products and may include bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps.

**2. Natural History:**

Food intolerances can develop at any stage in life but are often diagnosed in adulthood. They can be long-term conditions, and while they can cause discomfort, they are not life-threatening. Symptoms can often be managed through dietary adjustments.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Food intolerances are quite common, though their prevalence can vary based on genetic, ethnic, and cultural factors. For example, lactose intolerance is estimated to affect around 65% of the global population, with higher prevalence in people of East Asian, West African, Arab, Jewish, Greek, and Italian descent.

**4. Etiology:**

Food intolerances can occur due to several reasons including:

- Absence or shortage of certain enzymes needed to digest food. For example, lactose intolerance is caused by a shortage of the enzyme lactase.
- Sensitivity to food additives such as sulfites used to preserve dried fruit, canned goods, and wine can cause asthma attacks in sensitive people.
- Recurring stress or psychological factors.
- Celiac disease, where the immune system reacts to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

In food intolerances, the body's inability to digest certain foods or food components leads to their fermentation by gut bacteria, producing gas that results in bloating and discomfort. In lactose intolerance, the lack of sufficient lactase means lactose is not broken down and absorbed in the small intestine and instead, is fermented in the colon.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Conditions that may need to be differentiated from food intolerances include:

- Food allergies: Unlike intolerances, allergies involve the immune system and can be life-threatening.
- Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): This condition can have similar symptoms to food intolerances.
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Celiac disease
- Gastroenteritis

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

These are typically genetic. For example, lactose intolerance happens when the body doesn't make enough of an enzyme called lactase, which is needed to digest lactose, the main sugar in milk.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

A history of gastrointestinal diseases such as IBS, gastroenteritis, or celiac disease can increase the risk of developing food intolerances. In addition, individuals with a family history of food intolerances may be more likely to develop them.
