**Cholecystitis**

Cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder, often caused by gallstones blocking the tube leading out of the gallbladder.

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Common symptoms of cholecystitis include:

- Severe pain in the right upper abdomen, potentially radiating to the right shoulder
- Fever
- Nausea and vomiting
- Abdominal tenderness

**2. Natural History:**

Cholecystitis can be acute or chronic. Acute cholecystitis often presents suddenly, and can result in complications if not promptly treated. Chronic cholecystitis usually develops from repeated episodes of acute cholecystitis and can lead to a shrunken and non-functioning gallbladder.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Cholecystitis is a common gallbladder disease, with gallstones being present in about 95% of cases. It can affect people of all ages, but is more common in middle-aged and older individuals. It's more common in women than men.

**4. Etiology:**

Most cases of cholecystitis are caused by gallstones, which can block the cystic duct leading to inflammation. Less commonly, cholecystitis can be caused by tumors or other forms of blockage, severe illness, or certain infections.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

In cholecystitis, the gallbladder becomes inflamed usually as a result of obstruction of the cystic duct, typically by gallstones. This leads to increased pressure within the gallbladder and can cause ischemia and infection, leading to necrosis and perforation if left untreated.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Conditions that can mimic the symptoms of cholecystitis include:

- Gastroenteritis
- Gastritis or peptic ulcer disease
- Pancreatitis
- Appendicitis
- Right lower lobe pneumonia

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

While the exact cause of these diseases isn't known, they are thought to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Smoking can increase the risk of Crohn's disease and worsen its course. Diet may also play a role - a high-fat and low-fiber diet might increase the risk.

**9. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

Individuals with a history of gallstones, obesity, or rapid weight loss are at higher risk of developing cholecystitis. Certain conditions such as diabetes or blood disorders can also increase the risk. There's also a higher risk in individuals who have had multiple pregnancies.
