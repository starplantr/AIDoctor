**Esophageal Strictures**

Esophageal strictures are abnormal narrowings of the esophagus, the tube that carries food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach. 

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Symptoms can include difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), food getting stuck in the esophagus, regurgitation of food, chest pain, weight loss, and heartburn.

**2. Natural History:**

Esophageal strictures typically do not resolve on their own and may worsen over time if untreated. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms and prevent complications such as malnutrition and dehydration from inability to eat and drink properly.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Esophageal strictures can occur at any age but are more common in adults due to the nature of the causes. There is no significant gender or racial predilection.

**4. Etiology:**

Esophageal strictures may result from damage to the esophagus that causes inflammation and scarring, which can lead to narrowing. Causes can include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), swallowing corrosive substances, radiation treatment to the chest or neck, or damage from an endoscope. Rarely, strictures can be congenital (present at birth).

**5. Pathophysiology:**

The inflammation and scarring that leads to esophageal strictures can result from chronic exposure to stomach acid (as in GERD), irritation from swallowed substances, or damage from medical treatments. This process results in thickening and hardening of the esophageal tissues, reducing the diameter of the esophageal lumen and causing the characteristic narrowing of a stricture.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Conditions that may present similarly and need to be differentiated from esophageal strictures include:

- Esophageal cancer
- Esophageal spasm
- Achalasia
- Eosinophilic esophagitis

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

This is typically a complication of long-standing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Other causes may include damage from swallowing a corrosive substance, radiation therapy, or a systemic disease such as scleroderma.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

Previous history of GERD, swallowing corrosive substances, or receiving radiation treatment to the chest or neck can increase the risk of developing esophageal strictures. History of esophageal surgery or injury can also predispose to stricture formation.
