**Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD)**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

The most common symptom of peptic ulcers is abdominal pain, typically described as a burning sensation, that is often felt anywhere from the navel up to the sternum. Other symptoms may include:

- Changes in appetite, often accompanied by unintended weight loss
- Nausea
- Anemia, which may be associated with fatigue
- Gastrointestinal bleeding, evidenced by blood in the stool or vomit
- Bloating or a feeling of fullness

**2. Natural History:**

Peptic ulcers are a chronic condition that, if left untreated, can lead to complications such as bleeding, perforation, and blockage of the stomach. Once present, ulcers can recur and persist over many years. Treatment often leads to healing of the ulcer, but without addressing the underlying cause (like eliminating H. pylori or stopping NSAIDs), recurrence is common.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Peptic ulcers affect millions of people each year. They are more common in older adults who use NSAIDs regularly or who are infected with H. pylori. However, ulcers can occur in individuals of any age, including children.

**4. Etiology:**

Peptic ulcers occur when acid in the digestive tract erodes the inner surface of the stomach or small intestine. The acid can create a painful open sore that may bleed. The two most common causes of peptic ulcers are:

- Infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)
- Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen

**5. Pathophysiology:**

Peptic ulcers develop when there's an imbalance between the stomach's aggressive factors, such as acid and pepsin, and defensive factors, such as mucus, bicarbonate, and blood flow to the mucosa. The imbalance leads to inflammation, mucosal damage, and ulceration.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

The differential diagnosis for peptic ulcer disease includes:

- GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)
- Gastritis
- Gastric or esophageal cancer
- IBS (irritable bowel syndrome)
- Gallbladder disease

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

H.pylori infection and long-term use of NSAIDs are major risk factors. Other factors include smoking, alcohol use, and having a relative with the disease.

**8. Previous Medical History:**

A history of H. pylori infection or long-term NSAID use can predispose an individual to peptic ulcers. Other factors that can increase the risk include:

- Age: Older adults are more likely to develop peptic ulcers.
- Tobacco use: Smoking may increase the risk of peptic ulcers in people who are infected with H. pylori.
- Other medical conditions: Liver, kidney or lung disease, among other conditions, can increase the risk of PUD.
