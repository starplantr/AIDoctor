**Gallbladder Cancer**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Gallbladder cancer may not cause symptoms in its early stages. When symptoms do occur, they may include:

- Abdominal pain, particularly in the upper right portion of the abdomen
- Abdominal bloating
- Fever
- Loss of appetite and unintended weight loss
- Nausea and vomiting
- Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)
- Changes in color of urine and stool

**2. Natural History:**

Gallbladder cancer is often diagnosed at a late stage because it often gives no signs or symptoms early on. The late diagnosis often results in a poor prognosis. If left untreated, the cancer may spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, most commonly the liver and lymph nodes.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Gallbladder cancer is relatively uncommon. It's more common in older adults and women. People of certain ethnic groups, such as Native American and Mexican American populations, are at higher risk.

**4. Etiology:**

The exact cause of gallbladder cancer is unknown. It's thought to develop when healthy gallbladder cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. These mutations allow cells to grow out of control and to continue living when other cells would normally die. The accumulating cells form a tumor that can grow beyond the gallbladder and spread to other areas of the body.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

Most gallbladder cancers are adenocarcinomas, which begin in the cells that form the surface of the gallbladder (epithelial cells). Other types of cells in the gallbladder can become cancerous, but these occurrences are less common.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Gallbladder cancer can be confused with other diseases such as cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), cholelithiasis (gallstones), and other forms of liver and bile duct disease.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

Risk factors include female sex, older age, Native American race, gallstones and inflammation of the gallbladder, obesity, and certain genetic syndromes.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

Gallstones and chronic gallbladder inflammation are primary risk factors for gallbladder cancer. Other risk factors include a history of bile duct abnormalities, obesity, and certain ethnic backgrounds. Older age is also a risk factor.
