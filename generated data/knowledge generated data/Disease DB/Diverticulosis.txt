**Diverticulosis**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Most people with diverticulosis are asymptomatic. When symptoms do occur, they may include mild cramps, bloating, and constipation. Other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and stomach ulcers can cause similar problems, so the symptoms could be mistaken for those conditions. If diverticulosis leads to diverticulitis (inflammation or infection of the diverticula), symptoms may include severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and a marked change in your bowel habits.

**2. Natural History:**

Diverticulosis usually develops when naturally weak places in your colon give way under pressure, causing marble-sized pouches (diverticula) to protrude through the colon wall. It is a progressive condition that develops over time, often over many years. As a person ages, the risk of developing diverticulosis increases.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Diverticulosis is common in Western countries and is typically an age-related condition, with about half of people in the US having diverticulosis by age 60, and nearly everyone having it by age 80. It is interesting to note that it is less common in areas of the world where the diet is high in fiber, such as Asia and Africa.

**4. Etiology:**

The exact causes of diverticulosis are still unknown, but the condition has several possible risk factors:

- Aging: The risk of diverticulosis increases with age.
- Low fiber diet: Diets low in fiber can lead to constipation, which can create a hard stool and increase pressure in the colon, leading to diverticulosis.
- Obesity: Being seriously overweight increases your odds of developing diverticulosis.
- Smoking: Some studies have found that smoking may increase the risk of developing diverticulosis.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

Diverticulosis occurs when small, bulging pouches (diverticula) develop in your digestive tract, particularly the colon. When one or more of these pouches become inflamed or infected, the condition is called diverticulitis. The high pressure inside the colon due to muscle straining can push against weak spots in the colon where blood vessels pass through the muscle, forming a pouch or diverticulum.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Conditions that could present symptoms similar to diverticulosis include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), gastrointestinal infection, and colon cancer. Thus, these conditions should be ruled out while diagnosing diverticulosis.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

A low-fiber diet is a major risk factor for these conditions. Other factors include aging, obesity, smoking, lack of exercise, certain medications, and a high-fat diet.

**8. Previous Medical History:**

There are no specific conditions that increase the risk of diverticulosis, but people with a history of low-fiber diets, constipation, or smoking have a higher risk. Also, the risk increases

 with age.
