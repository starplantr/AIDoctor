**Angiodysplasia**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Angiodysplasia, also known as vascular ectasia, refers to abnormal blood vessels in the gastrointestinal tract. It can occur anywhere in the digestive tract but is most common in the colon. Symptoms may vary depending on the size and location of the lesions, but commonly include:

- Intermittent or chronic bleeding, leading to bloody or dark, tarry stools
- Anemia due to blood loss, presenting with symptoms such as fatigue, paleness, and shortness of breath
- In severe cases, acute gastrointestinal bleeding

In many cases, angiodysplasia is asymptomatic and only discovered during investigations for other conditions.

**2. Natural History:**

Angiodysplasia often presents sporadically and may go undiagnosed due to its often asymptomatic nature. It's usually a chronic condition and can persist indefinitely. The natural course of untreated angiodysplasia may include continued or intermittent bleeding.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Angiodysplasia is more common in older adults, with the prevalence increasing with age. It accounts for approximately 6% of all gastrointestinal bleeding and up to 40% of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the elderly.

**4. Etiology:**

The exact cause of angiodysplasia is unclear. It's thought to be related to age-related changes in the blood vessels and degeneration of the vessel wall. Other contributing factors may include low blood flow and increased venous pressure in the colon.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

Angiodysplasia occurs when blood vessels in the mucosa and submucosa of the digestive tract dilate and become abnormally fragile. This fragility can lead to spontaneous bleeding.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Differential diagnosis may include other causes of gastrointestinal bleeding such as diverticulosis, colorectal cancer, gastric ulcers, hemorrhoids, and inflammatory bowel disease.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

This is more common in older adults and may be related to aging and degeneration of blood vessels. It's also seen more frequently in patients with kidney disease or those who have aortic stenosis.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

There is no specific previous medical history that directly leads to angiodysplasia. However, certain conditions such as von Willebrand disease, chronic kidney disease, and aortic stenosis have been associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal angiodysplasia. Patients on anticoagulant therapy are also at higher risk for bleeding complications.
