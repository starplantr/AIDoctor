**Biliary Obstruction**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Symptoms of biliary obstruction can include:

- Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
- Abdominal pain (usually in the right upper quadrant)
- Nausea and vomiting
- Dark urine
- Pale stools
- Itchy skin
- Unexplained weight loss
- Fever or night sweats

**2. Natural History:**

If untreated, biliary obstruction can lead to serious conditions such as cholangitis (infection of the bile duct), pancreatitis, or liver disease. These conditions can be life-threatening.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Biliary obstruction is a relatively common condition, but the exact incidence is unknown. It can occur at any age but is most common in middle-aged and elderly individuals. It is slightly more common in females than males.

**4. Etiology:**

Biliary obstruction can be caused by a variety of conditions including gallstones, inflammation or scarring of the bile ducts, tumors of the pancreas or bile ducts, cysts, or parasites (in certain parts of the world).

**5. Pathophysiology:**

In biliary obstruction, there is a blockage in the ducts that carry bile from the liver to the small intestine. This causes bile to back up into the liver, leading to inflammation and potential damage to liver tissue.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Other conditions that can cause similar symptoms to biliary obstruction include hepatitis, cirrhosis, gallbladder disease, and other forms of liver disease.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

Gallstones are a common cause. Other causes include inflammation of the bile ducts, cysts, enlarged lymph nodes, tumors, or infection.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

People with a history of gallstones or inflammation of the bile ducts (cholangitis) are at increased risk of biliary obstruction. Other risk factors include a history of liver disease, pancreatitis, or pancreatic or bile duct tumors. A history of biliary surgery can also increase risk due to potential scarring or damage to the bile ducts.
