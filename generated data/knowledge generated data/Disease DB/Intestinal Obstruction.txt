**Intestinal Obstruction**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Symptoms of an intestinal obstruction can include:

- Crampy abdominal pain that comes and goes
- Loss of appetite
- Constipation
- Vomiting
- Inability to have a bowel movement or pass gas
- Swelling of the abdomen

**2. Natural History:**

Intestinal obstructions can be acute or chronic. Acute obstructions occur suddenly and require immediate medical attention. Chronic obstructions develop over a longer period and symptoms may come and go. If left untreated, an obstruction can lead to severe, life-threatening complications, including tissue death and sepsis.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Intestinal obstructions are a common surgical emergency. It is estimated that about 20% of hospital admissions for acute abdominal pain in the United States are due to small bowel obstruction. The condition can occur in individuals of any age but is most common in the elderly population.

**4. Etiology:**

Intestinal obstructions are most commonly caused by adhesions (scar tissue) from previous abdominal surgery. Other causes can include hernias, Crohnâ€™s disease, cancer, volvulus (twisting of the intestine), intussusception (one part of the intestine telescopes into another), and certain medications that affect the movement of the intestines.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

In an intestinal obstruction, the normal flow of the contents of the digestive system is blocked. This can occur in either the small or large intestine. The blockage prevents food, fluids, and gas from moving through the intestines in the normal way. The pressure in the bowel can increase, leading to a risk of the bowel rupturing.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Conditions that may present similarly to an intestinal obstruction include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), appendicitis, diverticulitis, peptic ulcer disease, gallbladder disease, and ovarian torsion or other gynecological conditions in women.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

This can be caused by various factors including hernias, strictures, diverticulitis, certain cancers, Crohn's disease, and abdominal or pelvic surgery.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

Any previous abdominal or pelvic surgery can increase the risk of intestinal obstruction due to the formation of adhesions. Other risk factors include a history of Crohn's disease, cancer, or conditions that affect the structure of the intestines like hernias.
