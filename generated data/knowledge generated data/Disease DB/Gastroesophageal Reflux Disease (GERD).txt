**Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

The symptoms of GERD can range from mild to severe and may occur at any time of the day. Some common symptoms include:

- Heartburn: This is the most common symptom, characterized by a burning sensation in the chest, usually after eating, which might be worse at night.
- Regurgitation: This is the sensation of acid backing up into your throat or mouth, producing a sour or bitter taste.
- Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
- Chronic cough or asthma
- Chest pain
- Feeling like there's a lump in your throat
- Hoarseness, especially in the morning
- Disturbed sleep

**2. Natural History:**

GERD is a chronic condition. Once it begins, it usually is life-long. If there is injury to the lining of the esophagus (esophagitis), this also is a chronic condition. Moreover, after the esophagus has healed with treatment and treatment is stopped, the injury will return in most patients within a few months. Once treatment for GERD is begun, therefore, it usually will need to be continued indefinitely.

**3. Epidemiology:**

GERD is a prevalent condition worldwide, and it is estimated to affect about 20% of the Western population. It can occur in people of all ages, but it is more common in adults over 40.

**4. Etiology:**

The main cause of GERD is a problem with the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) â€“ a circular band of muscle at the bottom of the esophagus that acts like a gate to the stomach. In GERD, this gate opens spontaneously for varying periods of time or does not close properly and stomach contents rise up into the esophagus. Other contributing factors include hiatal hernias, obesity, pregnancy, certain medications, and smoking.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

GERD occurs when the LES is weak or relaxes inappropriately, allowing the stomach's contents to flow up into the esophagus. The stomach produces hydrochloric acid after a meal to aid the digestion of food. The inner lining of the stomach resists corrosion by this acid because cells that line the stomach secrete large amounts of protective mucus. The lining of the esophagus does not share these resistant features and stomach acid can damage it.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

GERD's symptoms overlap with many other conditions. The differential diagnosis includes:

- Peptic ulcer disease
- Angina pectoris or myocardial infarction
- Gallbladder disease
- Eosinophilic esophagitis
- Functional dyspepsia
- Gastroparesis
- Achalasia

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor**

Lifestyle and predisposing factors for GERD include obesity, smoking, pregnancy, certain medications, and consuming certain types of food and drinks such as high fat foods, alcohol, caffeine, chocolate, and citrus fruits. Lying down or going to bed shortly after eating, particularly after having a large meal, can also contribute to GERD. 

**8. Previous Medical History:**

A history of certain conditions can predispose an individual to GERD:

- Hiatal hernia
- Asthma
- Diabetes
- Connective tissue disorders, such as scleroderma
- Zollinger-Ellison syndrome
- Delayed stomach emptying

Moreover, certain habits or medications can exacerbate GERD, including smoking, alcohol use, and medications like NSAIDs, certain muscle relaxants, and blood pressure medications.
