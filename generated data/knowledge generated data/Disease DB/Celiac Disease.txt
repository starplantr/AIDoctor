**Celiac Disease**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Celiac disease can present with a variety of symptoms which often vary between individuals. Typical gastrointestinal symptoms include diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, and weight loss. However, many people with celiac disease may have "non-classical" or no symptoms, which can include anemia, fatigue, osteoporosis, neurological symptoms (like headaches and peripheral neuropathy), skin rash (dermatitis herpetiformis), and problems related to malabsorption, such as vitamin deficiencies.

**2. Natural History:**

Celiac disease is a lifelong condition. Symptoms may appear in infancy or much later in life. If left untreated, it can lead to a variety of complications, including malnutrition, lactose intolerance, other autoimmune diseases, osteoporosis, infertility and miscarriage, neurological conditions, and in rare cases, cancer, especially lymphoma.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Celiac disease is estimated to affect about 1% of the population in Western countries, though many cases are undiagnosed. It can develop at any age after people start eating foods or medicines that contain gluten. The condition tends to be more common in women than men.

**4. Etiology:**

Celiac disease is caused by an immune reaction to gluten, a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye. It is considered an autoimmune disorder. Genetic factors play a key role, with the disease often running in families. Certain genes (HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8) are known to increase risk.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

In celiac disease, ingestion of gluten leads to an immune response in the small intestine causing inflammation and damage to the lining of the intestine. Specifically, the villi, small finger-like projections that promote nutrient absorption, are flattened. This damage impairs the absorption of nutrients leading to malnutrition and a variety of other complications.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

The differential diagnosis for celiac disease includes other causes of malabsorption like Crohn's disease, microscopic colitis, and short bowel syndrome. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity, irritable bowel syndrome, and wheat allergy can also present similarly. 

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

This is an autoimmune disorder that's triggered by consuming gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Family history of the disease significantly increases the risk.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

Having a first-degree relative with celiac disease increases your risk. Also, the disease is more common in people with other genetic disorders like Down syndrome and Turner syndrome. It's also more common in people with certain other autoimmune conditions, including type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, autoimmune liver disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.
