**Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (also known as Primary Biliary Cholangitis)**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic disease characterized by progressive inflammation and destruction of the small bile ducts within the liver. Symptoms can include:
- Fatigue
- Itchy skin
- Dry eyes and mouth
- Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
- Pain in the upper right abdomen
- Bone, muscle or joint (musculoskeletal) pain
- Hyperpigmentation of the skin
- Xanthomas (fatty deposits under the skin)

**2. Natural History:**

The natural history of PBC varies widely. Some individuals may remain asymptomatic and have a normal life expectancy, while others may develop symptoms and complications over time. Without treatment, progressive liver damage can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and associated complications.

**3. Epidemiology:**

PBC primarily affects middle-aged women, with a female to male ratio of about 9:1. It is estimated to affect 20-40 per 100,000 adults in the western world.

**4. Etiology:**

The exact cause of PBC is unknown. It's believed to be a multifactorial disease, possibly triggered by a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. It is considered an autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the liver.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

The pathophysiology of PBC involves chronic inflammation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to their destruction. This results in cholestasis, or reduced bile flow, which can cause damage to the liver cells (hepatocytes) and eventually lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Differential diagnosis should include other causes of cholestasis such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, and infiltrative diseases of the liver.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor**

Risk factors aren't well understood but may include genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and autoimmune diseases. It's more common in women and those with a family history of the disease.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

PBC often coexists with other autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and autoimmune thyroid disease. Therefore, a history of these conditions may be related to the disease. Patients with a family history of PBC or other autoimmune diseases may also be at increased risk.
