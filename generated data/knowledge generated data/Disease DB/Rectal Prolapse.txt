**Rectal Prolapse**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Rectal prolapse refers to the displacement of the rectum, so that it protrudes out of the anus. Symptoms include:

- Visible protrusion of the rectum through the anus, especially during bowel movements
- Pain, discomfort, and a feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation
- Mucus or blood discharge from the protruding tissue
- Fecal incontinence or leakage

**2. Natural History:**

Without treatment, rectal prolapse does not improve over time. The degree of prolapse may worsen, leading to increased discomfort, difficulty with bowel movements, and risk of damage to the rectal tissue.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Rectal prolapse can occur at any age, but it's more common in older adults, particularly women over 50. It's rare in children but when it does occur, it's more common in boys under 3 years.

**4. Etiology:**

The cause of rectal prolapse is not fully understood. Factors that may contribute to the development of rectal prolapse include:

- Chronic constipation or straining during bowel movements
- Weakness of the pelvic floor muscles
- Previous surgery or injury to the area
- Neurological conditions that affect the nerves of the rectum or pelvic floor

**5. Pathophysiology:**

Rectal prolapse occurs when the normal attachments of the rectum to the pelvis weaken, allowing the rectum to telescope out through the anus. This may occur due to long-standing increased intra-abdominal pressure, pelvic floor dysfunction, or nerve damage.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Differential diagnosis may include hemorrhoids, rectocele (prolapse of the rectum into the vagina), and intussusception. A careful physical examination and medical history can usually differentiate rectal prolapse from these conditions.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

Risk factors include long-term constipation, long-term diarrhea, old age, childbirth, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, whooping cough, multiple sclerosis, and paralysis.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

Previous pelvic surgery or injury, neurological diseases such as spinal cord injury, or conditions leading to chronic straining like constipation or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can increase the risk of rectal prolapse. Conditions leading to increased intra-abdominal pressure like obesity or pregnancy may also contribute to rectal prolapse.
