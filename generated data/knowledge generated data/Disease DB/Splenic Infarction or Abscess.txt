**Splenic Infarction or Abscess**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Symptoms of splenic infarction or abscess can vary greatly, depending on the severity of the condition. They may include:

- Abdominal pain, typically in the upper left quadrant
- Fever
- Chills
- Nausea and vomiting
- Diarrhea 
- Fatigue or general malaise
- Left shoulder pain due to referred pain (Kehr's sign)

For splenic abscess specifically, patients may also have signs of sepsis if the infection spreads.

**2. Natural History:**

Without treatment, splenic infarction or abscess can potentially lead to life-threatening complications such as rupture of the spleen and sepsis. However, with appropriate treatment, the prognosis can be quite good.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Both splenic infarction and abscess are relatively rare. Splenic infarctions occur in approximately 0.1-0.2% of patients undergoing abdominal CT scans, and splenic abscesses represent less than 0.2% of all abscesses.

**4. Etiology:**

Splenic infarction is usually caused by conditions that lead to a reduction or blockage of blood supply to the spleen, such as blood clots or sickle cell disease. Splenic abscesses are typically caused by an infection that has spread to the spleen, often from another location in the body, or following splenic trauma or splenic infarction.

**5. Pathophysiology:**

In a splenic infarction, a disruption to the blood supply of the spleen leads to tissue death. This can be due to a clot in the blood vessels that supply the spleen, or as a result of conditions that lead to reduced blood flow.

A splenic abscess occurs when an infection enters the spleen, resulting in pus formation within the splenic tissue. This can occur via hematogenous spread of bacteria, direct spread from nearby infection, or following splenic injury or infarction.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Conditions that could be considered in differential diagnosis include acute pancreatitis, left lower lobe pneumonia, kidney stones, gastric ulcers, or myocardial infarction, among others. 

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

Risk factors include conditions that increase the risk of blood clots, such as sickle cell disease or certain other blood disorders, cancers, and certain infections like bacterial endocarditis.

**8. Any Previous Medical History that is related to the disease:**

Previous medical history that might increase the risk of splenic infarction or abscess could include conditions like sickle cell disease, endocarditis, or other conditions associated with an increased risk of blood clots. Other risk factors could include a history of trauma to the spleen, or a history of immune-compromising conditions or procedures, such as chemotherapy or organ transplantation.
