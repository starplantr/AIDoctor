**Liver Cirrhosis**

**1. Clinical Manifestation/Symptoms:**

Early stages of cirrhosis may present with few or no symptoms. As cirrhosis progresses, symptoms can include:

- Fatigue and weakness
- Loss of appetite and weight loss
- Nausea or abdominal pain
- Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
- Itching
- Swelling in the legs (edema) or abdomen (ascites)
- Mental confusion, drowsiness, or slurred speech (hepatic encephalopathy)
- Easy bruising or bleeding
- Spiderlike blood vessels on the skin (spider angiomas)

**2. Natural History:**

Cirrhosis is the end result of chronic liver disease, characterized by replacement of liver tissue by fibrosis, scar tissue, and regenerative nodules. This leads to loss of liver function. Cirrhosis is generally irreversible once it occurs and can eventually lead to liver failure or liver cancer.

**3. Epidemiology:**

Cirrhosis is a leading cause of death worldwide. Prevalence varies across countries, largely due to differing levels of risk factors such as alcohol consumption and viral hepatitis. In the United States, cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause of death.

**4. Etiology:**

Common causes of cirrhosis include:

- Chronic alcohol abuse
- Chronic viral hepatitis (Hepatitis B, C, and D)
- Fat accumulating in the liver (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease)
- Iron buildup in the body (hemochromatosis)
- Cystic fibrosis
- Genetic digestive disorder (Alagille syndrome)
- Liver diseases characterized by your liver's cells being damaged or destroyed (primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis)

**5. Pathophysiology:**

Cirrhosis occurs in response to damage to your liver. Each time your liver is injured, it tries to repair itself. In the process, scar tissue forms. As the cirrhosis progresses, more and more scar tissue forms, making it difficult for the liver to function.

**6. Differential Diagnosis:**

Conditions that can mimic the presentation of cirrhosis include right heart failure, fulminant liver failure, and other causes of chronic liver disease. Hepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease may also present with similar symptoms.

**7. Risk factor/predisposing factor** 

The most common causes are heavy alcohol use, chronic viral hepatitis (B and C), and fatty liver disease associated with obesity and diabetes. Other potential risk factors include certain genetic diseases, a buildup of iron or copper in the body, cystic fibrosis, autoimmune disease, and destruction of the bile ducts.

**8. Previous Medical History:**

A history of chronic liver disease, such as chronic viral hepatitis or alcoholic liver disease, can lead to cirrhosis. Other conditions like hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, or autoimmune hepatitis can also progress to cirrhosis if left untreated.
